Come gather ye doubting OMSCS students so I can tell the true tale of how GT got to the top and disabuse ye on the lack of merits to the program,113,amz999,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/amz999/come_gather_ye_doubting_omscs_students_so_i_can/,30,1549264394.0,"I'm relatively new here. Just joined the program, I'm also a GT alumni from on-campus. In the month I've been on this forum, I've noticed a trend of posts dealing with apparent ""easy admissions"" to the program and what this supposedly portends on OMSCS job prospects or respectability or whatever. 

First, none of you seem to know the basic history of GT. But as someone who is a state resident and on-site alumni let me bring some simple truth to you right now. Until very recently, circa 2012-2014, it was relatively easy to get into GT in state. Even now, it's not impossible. Further as late as the early 2000s, GT WAS NOT an ""elite"" school. This phenomena occured recently, during the aughts probably. 

For those who's lived in GA for at least a decade or more, you'll know that it was well-known GT had a relatively laxed admission criterion for at least in-staters and it was the philosophy of the institute to admit as much as they can and ""weed out the weak"". Again this was definitely the policy for ON CAMPUS for many decades. Furthermore in state students even if not admitted could easily go the transfer route and spend 2 years at a less prestigious school and in some cases guarantee transfer if they passed a few criterons I believe. 

Again, neither of those two things which were probably in place since the 60s or 70s, probably earlier, stopped GT from ascending out of relative obscurity to become a fairly ""prestigious"" institute during the aughts and 2010s.

What you should also take note is that students who attend the state of Georgia's public school system in HS or primary school, attend one of the most inferior public school systems in the United States. As a former northerner, in my opinion even the ""magnate"" schools here in the south are inferior to some of the better public school systems in the north east. Yet many of these students, who came out that background went onto to go through to get their degree from GT and became, and are still becoming successful alumni, who happily give their $$$ every year when GT bothers them with envelopes during the spring and summer. 

GT got where it is cause of the fanaticism of its students. Georgia is not a rich state, GT never got the support of a U Michigan. UGA is the states favorite school anyways. The students are everything, and it's really a mentality and hardworking attitude that brings the accolades to GT. When I started on-campus, elite consulting firms or banks didnt even stop by during recruiting runs. When I graduated, they all did. Its cause information slowly spreads on the mentality here, and when tested, that information is validated. 

So please, stop with the obsession and petty bull s*** on eliteness and pedigree. If you're awesome, it will show in what you do, most of the time. The first thing you have to learn to become like ""real"" GT student is to shut up, keep your head down, and get back to work. Stop wasting time with this nonsense. Thank you ",2019-02-04 15:13:14

&#x200B;

I wasn't the 'typical' admitted students. I graduated with a bachelor in biology in May 2015 with ok gpa, and, to be honest, I still couldn't believe the moment I received the email congratulating my admission, it was like a dream come true, a life changer literally.

&#x200B;

I was a full-time student that took two classes each regular semester (eventually 3 because I screwed up) and a class every summer. I remember the day during my first semester, SDP and CN, I was so excited until I realized most of the people I know in my class and my group members has years in software development field while me, heh, I could only write some baby javascript. Then, the stress really starts to sink in where I know I have a lot a lot of work to do to be able to barely survive in this program. Let's just say I spent easily 10-20++ hours every assignment. A lot of it wasn't the concept being too difficult. In contrary, I feel that concepts are easy to grasp but to implement it was really hard as I was really limited by my programming abilities. It was the hardest when it first comes to group projects in SDP. I consider myself extremely lucky as my teammates who had years working quickly understand me coming as a complete newbie. It was a great start that I felt appreciated whenever I gave inputs and try my best not to write code that have them rolling on the floor laughing. I'll never forget these people who helped jumpstarted my omscs journey.

&#x200B;

Moving forward to KBAI, AI, ML, and other great classes, these classes are my absolute favorite but also my nightmare throughout the course. Well, except ML since I dropped the class after seeing a 30% on my first assignment, which I still kick myself sometimes for not sticking it out and finishing it. However, the difficulty of the program really starts now as these classes are really tough for me and I still spent easily 5x the average time my classmates took, but still get lower than median scores. It was depressing, I slipped up somewhere, getting Cs for the core classes of my specialization in which I have to retake them all and have 3 classes per semester. It was a hard time for me but it is also the time I cherished the most because it really was the moment I needed to realize that this is a really tough program and if I want to get out, I really do have to work my ass off, not even joking here.

&#x200B;

Fast forward until commencement day, it was an indescribable feeling when I stepped into McCamish Pavilion, wearing my graduation gown, walked up the stage to receive my degree and shared that moment with my family. It was unreal and all those sleepless nights and stay at home weekends suddenly feels so worth it. What a beautiful experience omscs had given me which I'll forever be thankful for and cherish. Without it, I wouldn't be able to write this up after coming home from work as a software engineer :)",2019-01-31 10:11:28

"4 years, 5 countries, and thousands of dollars later: I Got Out!",54,a6hz51,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/a6hz51/4_years_5_countries_and_thousands_of_dollars/,14,1544901824.0,"I first found out about OMSCS while I was a Peace Corps volunteer in the Dominican Republic. After 3 years of international development work, I was looking for a way to transition back into tech (specifically, software engineering, a field I was less familiar with) and given my scarce financial resources and location at the time I thought the program was a perfect fit.

I first applied in 2014 and was rejected. Re-applied in 2015--this time with a more competitive application--and was accepted. Took KBAI as my first class and though I found it to be challenging I was able to do well. Towards the end of 2015, I was running out of money and decided it was time to leave the Dominican Republic, so I returned to Los Angeles to live with my parents. I had $0 in my bank account by the time I was offered a TA position for KBAI which I readily accepted. Working as a TA also helped connect me with a startup based in Indianapolis which ended up hiring me for remote contract work. It was a relatively low paying gig but it enabled to gain some valuable experience and work from wherever I wanted.

Since I wasn't making much, I decided to go back to Argentina where I'm originally from and where the cost of living was far lower than California. I was there for only 1 month until the startup gave me the bad news that they were going to close up shop soon. Back to California I went as an unemployed student rapidly running out of capital to pay the relatively modest tuition fees.

Fortunately, after 3 months of interviews I landed a fantastic position with LinkedIn, where I'm currently at. The best part is that my employer reimbursed me for any OMSCS classes I took, as long as I got a B or above. Because of the flexibility, I was able to travel wherever I wanted and still make progress in my coursework. I remember having to take a ProctorTrack exam in Canada while standing up the entire time due to a lack of seating and having a project meeting with my team mates while traveling in Shanghai.

&#x200B;

I look forward to not only having my free time back but to no longer having the constant weight of looming assignments, projects and exams, which can make it impossible for you to fully disconnect during vacations and can complicate travel plans.

One suggestion for those of you still in the journey: If you've been in the industry for some time, no one really cares about your GPA. With that said, use the 80/20 rule to your advantage--80% of the results for 20% of the effort. Don't kill yourself trying to ace every class, in my opinion it's best to do well enough to pass and get credit but not be so hard on yourself that you never enjoy the material.

&#x200B;

Best of luck to those of you still in the game. One day you too will be able to say: I Got Out.

Accepted on my third attempt with a low GPA. Don't give up!,48,6gst3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/6gst3p/accepted_on_my_third_attempt_with_a_low_gpa_dont/,21,1497280290.0,"I see a lot of posts from people on this sub asking if it is even worth their time to apply to the program because they feel that their GPA is too low. My advice is definitely to give it a shot and don't be discouraged if you don't make it the first time!


A little background on me: I graduated with a BS in Computer Science in 2010 (just barely) from a small state university with a 2.78 GPA. At the time I really struggled with time management and an addiction to MMOs, WoW specifically. I played upwards of 80 hours per week towards the end of my undergrad and failed several classes purely because I didn't take the time to really study or focus on them. Around 2012 I finally quit and got my shit together and started to get serious about my career and gain experience and certifications in my field. 


In 2015 I had been working as a software developer at my alma mater for a year when I heard about the OMSCS program and decided to apply for it, hoping that my work experience would help prove that they could put my past problems behind and let me in. The first application, I received a very vague rejection letter that said that unfortunately the program was very competitive and they were unable to admit me.


So 2016 I decided to apply again but this time I took two classes (non-CS) that I had done poorly in before to boost by GPA and also received a project management certification and an IT services certification. I hoped that it would prove that I was serious about the program and would improve my chances of getting in. Again I received a rejection but this time they stated that I had a strong background in CS but that I should take a few 4000-level courses and get a B or higher to assuage their worries about my GPA and transcript.


In response to the second denial I decided to register for two courses: Design & Analysis of Algorithms and Human-Computer Interaction, and spent Spring 2017 working my ass off with the goal of making straight A's. Coming into the final weeks I had my A average in both courses so I submitted a third application for Fall 2017 and noted in my SOP that I currently held an A average in the courses and also attached a letter to the front of my transcript noting that I would send an updated one as soon as it became available.


To my delight, last Thursday I finally got the letter that I had been hoping for and was admitted into the OMSCS program! I guess the point is, don't let your past failures keep you from going for your goals! The committee will definitely recognize that you are taking steps to improve your chances and won't just define you based on the version of you that is on paper from previous years. Excited to get started in a few months!",2017-06-12 23:11:30

I have also coded with my mom, who thinks I am a very good boy. Last week my dev lead gave me a thumbs up before I went into the bathroom stall. 

I am saying this because when I enrolled into OMSCS I expected a CHALLENGE. I decided to take a software engineering course for my first semester because I thought, ""Hey, I have been doing engineering everyday for the past 80 years, I might as well learn more about it."" To much of my surprise, I am learning NOTHING. Right now we are doing basic stuff in Git. Really? Git? IN AN ENGINEERING COURSE? I would expect from a top 10 University I would be using quantum source control. If I can't store my quantum bits, what the hell am I doing with my life. WHY AM I WASTING 800 DOLLARS A SEMESTER WHEN I COULD BE TAKING OUT LOANS FROM A BANK TO GO TO ANOTHER SCHOOL THAT WILL TEACH ME THE SAME STUFF.

BREAKING: New Courses In Development,42,8wmf8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/8wmf8i/breaking_new_courses_in_development/,35,1530901296.0,"Joyner added a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/8telp9/for_a_top_10_program_im_very_much_concerned_with/e1w062b/?context=3&amp;amp;st=JJAAW5EW&amp;amp;sh=286a8985) with some very interesting information about new course development but it’s buried in a huge thread so I’m linking it here. 

tl;dr More courses coming, no guaranteed timeline, but there’s about 10 under development. Let the speculation begin!

Full text below:

>>Oh yes, absolutely: there are no plans to just film in-person lectures and upload them. We've had the conversation on the trade-offs between the two as well, but I haven't encountered any interest in the recorded lecture approach. That said, if an instructor came and said they wanted to launch their class online using filmed lectures but wouldn't launch it online if they had to custom-record it, we might have a conversation about whether it's better to have a class in that style or not have that class at all.

>>On new courses, it's worth knowing that this lull in production has a couple causes, but neither indicate a lack of future support or improvement for the program. For one, Udacity closed its Atlanta office in February, so support for these courses is shifting over to Georgia Tech. That's a non-trivial transition which is delaying things a bit.

>>Additionally, past experience has made us more cautious about announcing new courses when we're not almost certain that they'll launch when they say they will. Right now, there are 10 new courses under development that are past the stage where we would have announced them in the past, but we're not sure if they'll launch in Spring 2019, Summer 2019, Fall 2019, etc., and we don't want to announce until we know. In general numbers, though, I'd predict a couple new courses per semester the next couple years.",2018-07-07 02:21:36
Graduated recently - Here's my take on the ideal sequence of courses (ML specialization),44,8n5fax,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/8n5fax/graduated_recently_heres_my_take_on_the_ideal/,32,1527651425.0,"I graduated this Spring with a ML/CP&R specialization. Here's my retrospective of the ideal sequence of classes I *should have* taken. Please note that this is list is completely based on fantasy and may not be practical by any measure (due to factors such as non-availability, potential for failing miserably to meet the foundational requirements, sanity prevailing etc.). Read at your own risk (and excuse my poor English).

**GA**

Without doubt, this is THE foundational course for ML specialization and for a good reason. First, it will put you in the right mindset and prep you for the upcoming rigor of the program. Secondly, the concepts learned in this course are useful for the rest of the course.


**AI4R**

AI4R probably has the best introduction to Probability and Linear Algebra which, along with algorithms, form the basis of everything you learn in the following courses. There's a bit of Python for the uninitiated, but the course does a good job offering sufficient intro to succeed in AI4R and AI until you do a deeper dive in ML4T.


**AI**

Offers everything to catch up on the classic AI from the 60s onward to 90s and 00s. Has a much more rigorous treatment of Probability when you're glad you did AI4R first and search algorithms which is child's play after GA. The other tough topic is Propositional Logic (some of which you may have learnt if you also did KBAI, but easy to follow even if you didn't)


**ML4T**

Unholy(!) matrimony of Python (pandas, numpy), Finance, ML and RL. This is probably one of the most important classes in the program in terms of gratification-effort ratio. Offers a solid Python practice and introduction to ML and RL algorithms.


**DVA**

Offers valuable practical data science perspective such as cleaning raw data, visualizations and report making as well as more Machine learning practice. After this class you will be chewing through Kaggle datasets one after the other. Dealing with R can be a love/hate experience but in the worst case you'll learn to appreciate Pandas more.


**ML**

Finally the big one. Heavy emphasis on synthesis of Machine learning, Reinforcement Learning algorithms and Learning theory. With your solid background of algorithms (GA), probability, linear algebra and logic (AI4R, AI), your basic understanding of Machine Learning algorithms (ML4T, DVA) and your mad data and reporting skillz (DVA) you are all set for success.


**RL**

OK, why are we even doing this class at this point? Even though there is a heavy overlap with ML, this course offers a wondrous journey though academic papers and advanced concepts and can be a rewarding experience.",2018-05-30 11:37:05

I'm a fellow OMSCS student, and I'm hiring two data scientists at Wells Fargo (jobs just posted) and I think a lot of people in the OMSCS would be ideal candidates.

If you are interested, you can look at the job descriptions at [WellsFargo.com/careers](https://www.wellsfargo.com/about/careers/) and search for job opening IDs 5398649 (for a senior data scientist position) or 5398760 (for a mid-level data scientist position). Both jobs are open for any location (including remote / work from home), and are on my team, which is a centralized Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning group at Wells.

I'm looking for people who are strong Python coders who have an NLP / ML background and big data experience.

"Posts Regarding the quality of Students, piazza rants, etc.",35,5t1iou,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/5t1iou/posts_regarding_the_quality_of_students_piazza/,13,1486662312.0,"Hi everyone,

I think it would be a good idea to add a moratorium on new posts in the sub ranting about the quality of fellow students in classes, Piazza posts, etc. at least temporarily.

First of all, there have been several of these posts made in just the last 5 days or so. It is redundant, and there are active threads available to discuss this without the need to continually add more.

Second, this subreddit is not meant as a place to stroke one's ego about how everyone else in their classes seem to be less intelligent, prepared, qualified, etc. for the program. We get a lot of foot traffic of prospective students through here, and a large part of the program involves helping each other out via Piazza, the sub, and other communication means. When the front page of the sub is filled with redditors who feel as though they have some level of authority to begin talking poorly about other students in their classes, this discourages prospective students from posting here or applying at all. It also discourages other students in classes that are specifically called out in these posts from asking for help again on Piazza. It's toxic, and we should not tolerate it.

Third, no student has any real authority to begin claiming to know exactly what the admissions committee and program's faculty does right or wrong. We are not involved in those decisions, and there is no good that comes from sitting around lambasting those program administrators and faculty for letting in students that we as outside observers to the process deem unworthy. There is a fine line between discussion and condescension in this subject, and that line has been crossed very frequently in recent weeks.

So, as stated, this is a temporary moratorium on posts along these lines. The current posts that exist will stay open for discussion, but refrain from spamming the front page with even more.

Let's try to keep these discussions civil and fact-based, not driven by emotion and perceived truths.

Thanks,

###Analysis Details
---

Based on the responses in the [Fall 2016 admissions thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/3w66fi/fall_2016_admissions_thread/), I crunched some numbers to give people an idea of their odds. I pulled the stats on May 7, 2016, so any updates since then are not included. Anyone who hadn't heard back yet was treated as though the decision was rejection even though they might still be accepted. I arbitrarily assigned a true/false value for each post for a) selective undergrad school (acceptance rate <25%), and b) self-selected ""big tech"" company (post mentions working for a major tech firm). The median response time is actually an average of the lowest and highest possible median values given the data available.

Max | 226 days
Median | 90 days

I'm writing down some notes I took, for future people attending this nice class. This comes with the usual ""strings attached"" warning: everything is IMHO and YMMV. Also, the class has just been revised and it will probably undergo other changes in the next terms.

This is the syllabus for Fall 2018: [http://lucylabs.gatech.edu/kbai/fall-2018/](http://lucylabs.gatech.edu/kbai/fall-2018/)

So, here are my tips:

1. Homeworks:

Read the instructions. Read them again. **Put them in a bulleted list form.** Cover all the items from such list. Stay within the page limit and use the provided template.

Really, that's it: according to my own experience, and some of the TAs actual comments, most points are lost on missing items from the instructions. In a fashion similar to EdTech, the instructions for homeworks are in a narrative form. Such form usually contains many items; **you are expected to touch all of those items.** If you happen to do some mistakes while analyzing the items, grading is quite lenient; if you happen to skip some items, expect that to be pointed out.

2. Project (agent implementation):

While there's no secret sauce for this, my recommendation is: invest some time at the beginning to find out how to work with images (e.g. matrix/array representation for images, basic numpy) and how to compare images for equality; it will pay off. Also, don't work just to pass the exam. You can do it without reimplementing others' techniques, it's totally doable! Experiment and enjoy. Also, for Python projects:

* Make sure you're using the same Python version as the Bonnie autograder ( Python 3.4 or Python 2.7 for Fall 2018) and the very same dependencies version.
* Learn how to use [https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and [https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) and [https://pypi.org/project/pip/](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) . **This will save you a lot of headaches,** because things may seem to work, until they don't.
* Make sure you set the proper language major (python for python2, python3 for python3) in the .txt file that Bonnie reads.
* Always use the error-check before submitting, with a script like ""./error-check && ./submit"".
* If submitting to Bonnie takes a long time without feedback, **don't Ctrl-C and retry.** Check on Bonnie web interface: sometimes it's just slow, or the interactive submission script locks, **but the submission goes on and you can download your results from the webinterface.** Each submission counts against your submission limit! Even if you Ctrl-C, your submission will be processed. So, feel free to interrupt the process, but don't resubmit until you've checked the web interface.
* Check everything with Linux or Mac before submission. Especially, convert the sources from (possibly) CRLF newlines to LF-only newlines, and see if anything changed (on the right OS). I've heard issues when using Windows, especially with the newline char being misinterpreted (people thought they had set ""python3"", but the ""3"" was actually in a newline). Maybe you can leverage the WSL layer with a terminal editor like Vim, but I've got no specific suggestions on the topic, other than ""pick a Linux distro like Ubuntu and use it in a VM"".

&#x200B;

3. Project (report):

That's very similar to the homework. Be sure to touch all the items from the project description, try to be exhaustive without entering minor implementation details. It's a reflection on how you did your work. The only real suggestion is: **keep track of the modifications you do while writing your agent.** It's totally possible to get an agent that works well, but forgetting how you got there; but you'll need its history to properly write your report.

4. Proctored exams

This is a part I personally disliked, but they're not necessarily too hard. I would suggest to: a) watch the lessons b) take a look at the additional materials c) take notes and have them available (exam is open book). During the exam, **make sure you're totally focused.** The exam consists of 75 true-false questions, grouped in 15 five-question pages, to be answered in 60-minutes, and many of them are quite tricky from a language standpoint. You need to read them, then re-read them, then answer, remembering that in each group of five questions there's at least one false and one true statement, and that if you tick nothing in one group you don't get any score at all. Don't expect questions to be pulled straight from the lessons or the textbook; they often involve reasoning. I suggest you first take a look at all the groups, tick all the questions you're 100% sure are true, then go back and re-check the ones you're unsure about. But again, **stay focused**. Don't take the exam when you're tired, or after an hard day's work. You'll be dissatisfied with the results.

Happy KBAIing!

List of Online Colleges/Universities for getting OMSCS Prerequisites,31,9smzmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/9smzmo/list_of_online_collegesuniversities_for_getting/,19,1540899219.0,"Good morning, I am currently doing some research on which university/community college I can go and do online to fulfil the OMSCS pre-requisites (see below for preliminary list). 

I am asking for feedback from international persons (outside the US or other persons as applicable) who successfully did courses about the process for applying for courses and how it factored into their application (e.g. took about 10 courses and got in to OMSCS).

I am also hoping that this can be a comprehensive listing that persons can use to get CS courses, this was also done based on the number of ""need prerequisite courses to do""/""what are my chances"" posts. In my research (preliminary) I realised that some colleges don't allow international students, so I wanted to avoid researching information on those colleges.

**OMSCS CS Admissions Criteria for success**

* Bachelor's degree or its equivalent (prior to matriculation) (in anything)
* *From a recognized institution (meaning the school is accredited)*
* *Demonstrated academic excellence (Generally a reasonable undergraduate GPA)*

* Evidence of preparation in their chosen field sufficient to ensure successful graduate study (this generally means that you have enough CS courses to satisfy admissions that your not going to to ""fail-out"" your courses due to lack of knowledge)

**I don’t have the academic credentials for full admission now, but I would like to work toward that. What advice do you have?**
> The best advice is to take (and pass) courses in computer science from an accredited institution. 

So, I looked up on GatTech's site and I found this (for the on campus program):

[**What types of prerequisite courses?**](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/faq)
> The student should have an undergraduate level of proficiency in core computer science areas including operating systems, design and analysis of algorithms, formal languages and automata theory, networking and communications, theory/algorithms, and computer architecture. 

* Operating Systems
* Design and analysis of algorithms (my understanding is that this is the most important course)
* Formal Languages and automata theory
* Networking and Communications
* Theory/Algorithms (I am wondering if this is duplicated)
* Computer Architecture.
* Discrete Mathematics (not stated on the website but most MS lists that as a requirement - based on the threads I have read this and analysis of algorithms are the courses you need to have, and need to get a A in to prove you can pass CS courses at a graduate level)
* Data Structures (also not stated but needed)

Therefore this post seeks to determine which are the best colleges and universities to do the pre-requisite courses

**University/Community College**

* Foothill College
* University of Southern Queensland
* Oakton Community Collage
* Oregon State University
* Old Dominion University
* Thomas Edison State University
* University of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign and Springfield)
* North Carolina State University
* Charter Oak (from edx Python Course)
* Harvard Extension
* University of Massachusetts Lowell
* Florida State University (Distance Learning)
* Dakota State University
* Gavilan Community college (Has online course for the Discrete Math prerequisite)
* [DePaul University] (https://www.cdm.depaul.edu/academics/Pages/Current/Requirements-MS-in-Computer-Science.aspx)
* Stanford SCPD
* Washtenaw Community College (Distance Learning)
* Massey University in NZ

KBAI changes coming Fall 2018,29,94kwkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/94kwkf/kbai_changes_coming_fall_2018/,12,1533404342.0,"I took HCI over the summer, and Prof Joyner wrote this in Piazza today about upcoming potential changes to KBAI:

""We'll be changing it, but somewhat iteratively. I wouldn't say there's a big one-semester refresh in mind, but more a series of small changes.
 

In Fall, we tentatively plan to stick to the overall model we've had in the past (6 assignments, 3 projects, probably with our usual ""choose 3 of 6"" assignment model), but I'm strongly considering adding 3 short proctored exams. The biggest complaint about the class in the past has been that the assessments don't map to the lecture material, and that's entirely true, mostly because the lecture material is tough to assess with the kinds of programming projects we actually want to do. So, I'm considering adding exams exactly like we have in HCI: multi-correct multiple-choice, open-book open-note open-internet, etc. specifically about the course material and readings.

 

I also want to inch the class away from having really high pressure to create agents that perform well, and instead incentivize experimentation and creativity. So, I'd like to keep the Raven's project, but probably only as one project instead of 3, and grade the project based more on the reflection about the code and the amount of experimentation/iteration than on its final performance. We'll probably have some incentive to do well, but it won't be something that is required for everyone.

 

Longer-term, I'd love to try a more ""library"" approach to the projects. Instead of everyone doing the same Project 3, for instance, we could offer a set of four Project 3s to choose from. But I don't know if that will be ready for Fall.

 

So, TL;DR: maybe adding exams and readings, shifting the projects away from testing performance, but otherwise staying pretty true to the class.""",2018-08-05 01:39:02

Research Master Post,27,9t48b2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/9t48b2/research_master_post/,24,1541029064.0,"There’s been several questions on Slack and on Reddit about research and how to get involved with it that I've given pretty much the same answer to recently, so I figured it would be good to make a master post of resources and advice about how to get involved with research. Feel free to provide suggestions or additional content comments. **Obligatory disclaimer:** this is primary the opinion of one person who isn’t a professor at Georgia Tech. 

**General comments**

Contrary to popular belief, it is definitely possible to get involved with research as part of OMSCS. The opportunities to do so are limited by the fact that research doesn’t scale nearly as well as other aspects of the program, but for the right students it is a possibility.

**What is “research”?**

Most people with computer science degrees don’t do much “science” at all. The job of the vast majority of people with CS degrees is to design, implement, and maintain computer programs and computer systems. Computer science researchers by contrast develop new things: new ideas, new systems, new algorithms, etc.

Computer science research is, at its core, the production of new ideas about computers. Pretty much every subject that you can take a computer science course in is a field you can do research in: databases, compilers, algorithms, machine learning, .... You can even do research on particular programming languages like Python (as well as on programming languages in general).

Regardless of the field, the day-to-day of computer science research is very different from the average day-to-day of other forms of computer science. Research progresses slowly and involves a large amount of thinking, reading, and writing. It can, but doesn’t have to, involve writing code or solving equations. The best way to get a feel for what research in a particular subfield is like is to read academic papers in your subfield of interest and think about how enjoyable it would be to read and write papers like those, as well as carry out the computation and analyses that they contain. 

**What is the connection between research and “theory”?**

Contrary to popular perception, pretty much all fields of computer science has theoretical research and applied research. The people who develop the algorithms Uber uses to assign routes efficiently do applied algorithms research, and the people who prove theorems about relational algebra do theoretical databases research. As a general rule, the level of mathematical formalism and mathematical sophistication required to do research is determined by how theoretical the research is, not by the field it is in.

One major culprit for this confusion is the badly named umbrella terms “CS Theory” and “Theoretical Computer Science” which apply to the most theoretical work in some, but not all, fields of computer science. The exact boundaries of TCS depend on the country, but by and large it applies to the mathematical analysis of computers and computation. There is theoretical computer science research that doesn’t fall under those umbrella terms.

**What does it take to do research?**

The best way to get started is to read research that interests you. Research is methodologically very different from software development or computer science homework, and reading and discussing research is the best way to get acquainted with the methodologies of computer science research. Many people will also need to practice their writing skills, as a very significant part of doing research is writing about it. What exactly “computer science research methodology” is depends on the subfield, though many fields have broadly speaking similar approaches and many skills are cross-discipline transferable

Besides becoming acquainted with research methodology, the other major prerequisite is to get to the edge of existing work. This can be maintained by reading cutting edge research, but previous coursework and practical experience is also necessary. It’s much easier to get to the edge of a field by reading textbooks and taking courses than just reading research papers, but once you reach the cutting edge there isn’t anything else you can use to maintain said edge other than read research.

It’s important to note that you don’t need to accomplish all of this before starting your first research project. In fact, during your first research project you’ll almost surely learn that your preparation was insufficient in some way. That’s totally okay and to be expected. Finding a research project where your current skill sets can contribute is key. Most projects have many parts, including theoretical work, project design, implementation, data collection, and analysis. Being able to significantly contribute to one or two portions of this pipeline is sufficient to be able to significantly contribute to a research project.

**How do I get involved in research?**

There are two kinds of research, mentored and un-mentored. Both have benefits and shortcomings, largely dependent upon your background. Un-mentored research is logistically easier to carry out and allows for more freedom and flexibility at the cost of not (necessarily) giving you direct access to an expert in the field. Mentored research is just the opposite: there’s a lot more rules and structures imposed on you, but you have a wealth of knowledge and experience to draw on that you might not otherwise have access to.

I’ll talk about how to get involved with mentored research in the next few sections, so I’ll skip that for now.

One way to do un-mentored research is to *just do it*. However, most people in OMSCS don’t have previous experience doing research, and it’s hard to start from nothing. As a result, un-mentored research projects tend to involve one or more students with previous research experience (and sometimes others that don’t have said experience). The best way to find a fellow OMSCS student who has research experience and is interested in collaborating with you is to talk to people. Share your ideas and ask them about theirs. Students with research experience regularly talk about their research interests on slack, especially in #research and #phd but also in #jobs, #lobby, and other places. #research is probably the best place to start connecting with other students who are interested in doing research.

**How do I get a professor to mentor me to do research?**

The process for this is relatively straightforward, if hard to actually pull off.

1. **Identify professors with shared research interests.** Do a lot of research into professors. Read their papers. Think about the overlap in your interests. People usually don’t agree to supervise or mentor students with divergent interests, so make sure there’s a good fit.

2. **Take courses with them.** Except in rare circumstances, you need to take courses with a professor for them to have any idea who you are.

3. **Impress them in class.** Lots of people get As, but you want the professor to know who you are and have a specific opinion about you as a person. The best way to do this is with participation in class. Piazza keeps statistics of who contributes the most, but quality is as important as quantity (if not more). Answer difficult or theoretical questions asked by other students. Ask questions that go beyond the course materials, perhaps about cutting edge research. Write in-depth explications of projects that end up being cribbed by the professors for future course materials. Share testing resources that you’ve developed with the class. You probably already know who the students doing these things in your courses are - use them as models.

4. **Establish a relationship outside of class.** Email, Slack, phone calls. Whatever it is, don’t have your interactions end when the class is over. Your main goal here is to stay on their radar. An easy way to do this is to continue to take courses with them or TA for them. This can be skipped if you continue to step 5 during or immediately after a course with the professor.

5. **Discuss their research with them.** Contact then about their recent or current research and demonstrate that you have interesting things to say about it. This is partially to show that you’ve done your research on them and their interests and partially to demonstrate to them that you have interesting things to say about research. No one is expecting you to propose the next groundbreaking project, but showing that you can understand the context and potential extensions of research is important, as well as the fact that you can form coherent and worthwhile ideas and opinions about research methodology. Ask them why they used X instead of Y. Ask them if combining their methodology with one from another paper you’ve read would improve the results (and have good reasons to think it would).

6. **Ask them to do research with you.** Congrats! You’re here! Tell them that you want to get involved with doing research and ask them if they’d be willing to mentor your project. Best of luck.

**Picking the right professor(s)**

Mentoring research is a time-consuming task that scales poorly compared to other aspects of a masters degree. You need to find someone who is willing to devote a substantial amount of time to you, which is a combination of topic fit, personal fit, and the professor being willing. The first two are partially under your control, but part of it is simply finding a professor who is predisposed to being willing to agree. This changes over time, so ask around on Reddit or Slack for who has a reputation for taking on research mentees.

**Doing research for course credit**

There are several ways to get course credits for research you do.

1. **CS 8903:** This course is a mentored research project. You need special permission to take it and you need to line up a professor who agrees to oversee it, but it’s a very doable way to get course credits for your project.

2. **Education Technology:** This course is one course-long project that you can do on any subject vaguely relevant to education. It’s a great way to get a jump start on your research project and a good chance to impress the teacher (David Joyner). Many students who do research started off in this class and then continue their project afterwards.

3. **Masters Thesis or Project:** A common misunderstanding is that you need to complete the program by taking ten courses. However, you can also compete the project or thesis mode of the master’s degree. You can read more about these options [here](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/future/masters/mscs). If you do a thesis or project, you replace some of your elective courses with research credit hours. A professor confirms that this is an option [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/95omtt/comment/e3uvnho?st=JNYM466N&sh=0db901ca). Projects are far more common than theses, and both options are quite rare (both in general and amongst OMSCS students). There’s usually a better way to achieve your end goals, but it is an option.

**Research communities**

Communities are very important for doing research. Whether it’s editing a research or just getting feedback on your latest idea, research is a fundamentally social endeavor. David Joyner has put together a community of researchers in [LucyLabs](http://lucylabs.gatech.edu/). On Slack, there’s a #phd and #research channel you can join to talk about research. There’s also topic specific channels for most major research topics. 

Some research communities have online manifestations you can join. For example, there are Stack Exchanges dedicated to research level questions, including [Math Overflow](https://mathoverflow.net) and [CS Theory Stack Exchange](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com). Although it isn't exclusively dedicated to ML or to research, most ML research questions are on-topic at [Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/). 

**What about a PhD?**

Well, what about a PhD? You do not need a PhD to do research. That said, most people who have jobs doing research have PhDs. The primary reason for this is that there are very few entry-level research jobs. Instead, people do PhDs to learn to do research and establish themselves as researchers. If you want to do research for a living, you probably need a PhD. However there are lots of jobs that involve research or are research adjacent that don’t require them, and you can always do research on your own without one.

PhDs are long and hard. In the US, the first two years of a PhD are pretty much a master’s degree (and you’ll often get a MS for doing it). If you want to do a PhD, you should seriously consider why you’re doing a master’s program. There are valid reasons, but it’s worth wondering if you shouldn’t apply for a PhD program now instead.

OMSCS is a masters-only degree, and you need to apply to the PhD program to do a PhD at Georgia Tech after the masters. There are students who have graduated and gone on and done PhDs (both at Georgia Tech and at other universities) but OMSCS is not a backdoor to the CS PhD at Georgia Tech.",2018-11-01 07:37:44

OMSCS numbers,26,9iyjn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/9iyjn9/omscs_numbers/,12,1537929002.0,"from Zvi Galil:

Hello, OMSCS students and instructors.

 

I hope your semester is off to a good start. We are very proud of your efforts!

 

We are also proud to share some new numbers about the program. As of Fall 2018, the number of students in the OMSCS program comes to 7,688. This is an astonishing number. When we had only half this many students, Harvard researchers said we were the largest MS CS program in the country - and possibly the world.

 

That's only the beginning of the good news. We have received 2,739 applications for Spring 2019 - a 36 percent jump from the previous spring semester application record, and fall applications are always even higher. We also have 564 students registered to graduate this term. We know that some of these students will end up getting delayed, but we also know we will graduate more than 1,000 students from the program this year.

 

Including OMSCS, we have roughly 11,500 students in the College of Computing (we will have the exact number in mid-October). These are astonishing numbers - we have 15 times the number of students of Harvey Mudd College, and about 12 times the number of students at Agnes Scott. If the college were its own university, two of its instructors would have their own colleges - Charles Isbell, who teaches slightly more than 3,000 students, and David Joyner, who teaches more than 3600.

 

This term we have 232 TA’s: 85 on campus students, 100 OMSCS students and 47 OMSCS alums (not including Jill Watson and her sisters). This is awesome. We couldn’t do it without you, OMSCS students and alums.

 

The rest of the world remains eager to learn more about the OMSCS success story. I will be giving a keynote lecture at the IEEE conference on ""Learning with MOOCS"" in Madrid this Thursday, at 1:15PM, Sept. 27. After that I will be speaking at the University of Padova at 2:30 pm on Monday October 1, and at the University of Edinburgh on October 5. If you would like to attend any of these lectures, please let me know - I love having OMSCS students in the audience! I usually ask them to give their own perspective.

 

Best wishes for a successful fall semester, and many thanks for all you do to make our OMSCS program unique.

 

Sincerely,

Just sharing my joy for prospective students. This is my first semester and I applied not really being sure that I could handle the two class workload along with my job. What's more due to unforeseen circumstances I switched jobs in between applying and starting class. I was genuinely worried about doing well at the new job and keeping up in the new classes.

I think if you pick your first classes well you can do it. I picked 6250 (computer networks) and 6750 (human computer interaction). I was late (400+ waitlist on both courses) but got in by the end of the registration period just sitting steady. Both are rated 2.5 difficulty on omscentral.com but are well reviewed (I figure I should ration myself to one Joyner a year). I figure I might drop to a 1 class semester for the really hard ones like BD4H or GA (if i ever get in haha).

I decided to tackle this by always finishing assignments early. Ive done some online courses before and last minute rushes against a deadline is never nice especially when you run into a technical issue and need support but dont have time to wait for it.

I'm also blogging my CN class notes to share with coworkers at work. Writing it up makes me retain stuff better and fortunately I work at a place where randomly sharing stuff like this just because is welcome.

I am worried about group classes and classes that dont use python (i'm a python/JS guy). But I'll climb those hills when I get there. I intend to do Machine Learning concentration just like presumably 90% of folks.

I found out I was admitted about 72 hours ago, and I've spent the past two days researching what I've gotten myself into. Appears to be a hell of a thing. I put together the following on my [personal blog](https://ryanwingate.com/omscs/economics/) talking myself through my decision to accept the offer. Thought it might be useful to someone else wrestling with the same question of whether or not to actually take this thing on.

---

As I [wrote previously](https://ryanwingate.com/omscs/about/), I recently accepted an offer of admission to the Georgia Tech Online Masters of Science in Computer Science. This post discusses the economic and professional reasons why I chose to pursue this degree.

# The Economic Calculus

A CS masters can be conservatively expected to garner a salary bump in the neighborhood of $5K to $10K per year over a CS bachelor's degree from the same school. [Some estimates](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-masters-subjects-that-increase-pay-the-most/#8-english-literature-17-increase-10) indicate the average salary increase is much higher, with the resulting raises measured in the tens of percents. In my case, a masters in CS will enable me to transition from mechanical engineering into the more lucrative computer science field. It will also, most likely, help me enter the rapidly growing and dynamic tech industry, which pays much more than ag, a pertinent point of comparison. My compensation premium from completing this degree is therefore likely to be much more than it would be for the typical software engineer.

Since the out-of-pocket cost for the degree is less than $8K, the pay-back period for the OMSCS degree as a strictly financial ""investment"" can be expected to be less than a year. By that simplistic standard, pursuing the degree is a no-brainer.

The other, more conservative way to estimate the value of the degree is by assigning a dollar value to the time required to complete it. Estimating that it will take [20-30 hours/week](https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/46z4gc/average_time_commitment/) over the course of 3 years, finishing the degree will likely require somewhere between 3000 and 4500 total hours ""invested."" Valuing time at $40/hour, this is an implied average ""time cost"" of $150K.

I will be in my early 30s before the degree is completed, so I estimate that I will have a roughly 30-year career over which to recoup that ""time investment."" To offset a one-time, $150K ""expenditure,"" I calculate I would need to earn an additional $10K per year to break even over the long term (assuming a 5% discount rate). This is a very reasonable expectation, especially given my particular situation. And, valuing time in this way assumes that I could put an extra 1250 hours/year to productive use, and not spend them watching Netflix, for example. Doubtful.

Based on the foregoing, the GT OMSCS program appears to be time, and money, very well spent.

# Other Considerations

And, the foregoing doesn't even take into account the less tangible benefits:  
- more satisfying work,  
- higher-performing colleagues,  
- personal growth and enrichment associated with completing additional education,  
- the fact that 20-30 hours/week of something new is a much more life-affirming proposition than spending that same amount of additional time ""grinding"" at a tedious job, and the  
- ""interest satisfaction"" associated being in a growing and cutting-edge field.

Even if the economic calculus didn't work out as well as it does, those less tangible benefits are worth a significant financial investment in and of themselves. As an OMSCS student, based on the analysis just presented, over the long term, I'll essentially get those benefits for free (if I don't actually end up money ahead). 

Now to figure out how to do this program without failing...",2018-03-23 20:47:57

>In offering a degree, Georgia Tech faced the challenge of ensuring that its online venture not harm the school’s reputation for rigor. Unlike traditional massive, open, online courses, or MOOCs, OMS CS maintains the same rigorous admission requirements as its on-campus program, which accepts only 12 percent of applicants. However it uses a “new paradigm” to evaluate applicants, says Galil. Instead of “admission by rejection”—turning down large numbers of people fully capable of succeeding—OMS CS is not constrained by physical classroom space and thus can admit all qualified candidates, or 60 percent of applicants. While that’s a “terrible” selectivity rate for top-rated brick-and-mortar universities, Galil acknowledges, coursework and exam grades indicate that both online and on-campus students are “roughly the same in performance.”

~

I have always wanted to work with computers and how they operate. I started developing my skills at about the age of 13, when I got into very simple web development and fiddled around with Linux quite a bit. 

This led me to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering. At school, I would always focus on both Software and Hardware, typically working on Java with Assembly and low level C. Indeed, my Capstone project was a mixture of an embedded system and a web app – a mixture of Java, C, and the typical HTML/CSS/JS stack.

On my first full-time job, I helped develop the United States Coast Guard App, developed a mobile app (SentiGuard), a web app that integrated with the mobile app, and the API that that same mobile app consumed. That project had so many facets and integrations, that it provided a good learning environment where I could greatly enhance my skills. I quickly became the go-to individual for everything technical.

In pursuit of a better learning environment, I moved to New York in early January 2015 to work at a startup. I was introduced to the best practices of the industry, and had to swiftly absorb this knowledge and adjust how I worked. Everything from Agile, Functional Programming, Continuous Integration & Deployment, to Testing and its different incarnations, not to mention a plethora of languages and frameworks that I had to learn – was now widely available for me to master.

At Intent Media, my current employer, we provide an ads platform for travel sites. I deal with the client & server that manages these ads (everything from the newest Javascript frameworks, to emerging languages like Elixir), as well as some of the data models that allow us to place these ads in the most profitable configuration. We are the industry leader when it comes to segmentation of users in travel sites, and it feels good to be part of the team that can claim that.

I have always been fascinated with how technology shapes the world; how it enhances the human experience, adds dimensions of understanding and wonder, and expands the impact each and every one of us can have. Because of this, I have a deep, personal commitment to technology: I do not want to simply develop new technologies – I want to understand them; I want to drive their innovation. 

While I enjoy building machines and the code that drive them, I am also a fan of building businesses that proliferate said machines. Software has given rise to a new category of entrepreneurial behemoths: entities whose sole purpose is to push the boundaries of technology even further. I want to be part of that ecosystem and help deliver exciting new systems, features, and products – all from a technical perspective.

In my short years as a Software Engineer, I have not seen many solutions and engineering teams that have an academic base, or that weave actual computer sciences into their everyday development cycle. And, while it is true that not all problems or markets warrant a full-on academic approach, there are certainly practices and takeaways from the sciences that can be applied. I want to be that changing force, and I believe that by better grasping these theoretical and practical principles, I can promote and incorporate said practices into any workplace – especially my own venture. 

Research-and-development is also an area of great importance to me, personally. I spend many hours ideating potential systems and services that could help revolutionize existing problems and solutions, particularly in artificial intelligence, automation, and infrastructure and would love to take these ideas further. Even more, I seek to establish an enterprise that is founded on R&D, and genuinely looks to adapt, adopt and sponsor new ideas.

To this end, I feel I need to go back to school and better prepare for that future; I understand most advanced concepts, but lack the depth needed to successfully implement them in real world scenarios. I believe the College of Computing of Georgia Tech, in particular the Online Masters in Computer Science, is the best choice for remedying that. Aside from being one of the best engineer schools in the nation (which has always been in my sights, since I majored in Computer Engineering), I was very impressed by the course list. As of late, I have been interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and courses like Machine Learning for Trading, Natural Language and Machine Learning Theory look especially promising. But the price point, and the fact that I can complete the degree online, is the high point of this program: being able to focus on my career, and pursue an affordable post-grad degree – from Georgia Tech nonetheless – is very exciting. Simply put, there is no other highly respected institution that offers such a complete, flexible and accessible program.

**What is Phase I and Phase II Registration?**

Phase 1 is for returning students only. It occurs \~2-3 months before classes start. Phase 2 is for everyone. New students register during Phase 2.  It occurs surprisingly late, about \~1 week before classes start.  See the official [Academic Calendar](https://registrar.gatech.edu/calendar)

**How do I view my time ticket?**    
Log into [Buzzport](https://buzzport.gatech.edu/). OSCAR Registration -> Student Services -> Registration -> Registration Status -> Select Term. Note that new students will not have time tickets until late in the game.  Check your email regularly for information about Phase II registration.

**Why is my time ticket so late?**

Time tickets are assigned in 15-minute increments and are assigned by seniority. Those who have completed more courses will get earlier time slots. Courses you are currently taking do not count towards your # completed courses.

**Will I be able to get into class X?**

In general, for new students, the following courses are hard to get into: ML4T, CN, SDP, GA, IHI (unless you sneak in on waitlist drop day). For 2nd+ course, you are likely to get into any course except GA. You will probably not get into GA until around the end of your degree.

**I'm registered for A, I'm on the waitlist for B, can I also waitlist for C as a back up?**

""Even once the wait lists are active, your total number of enrolled + waitlisted hours should **never** be more than six hours"" -from OMSCS emails that get sent out about registration and waitlists

The system will not prevent you from registering/waitlisting for more than 6 credits. However, GaTech admins will manually check every so often, and if they see you are registered/waitlisted for more than 6 credits, they will manually knock you to the bottom of the waitlist. I have not read any experiences of this actually happening, so it might be a rumor to scare students into not waitlisting for too many classes. But the rules explicitly state not to do this and better safe than sorry.

**I'm waitlisted at position \_\_\_. Will I be able to get into \_\_\_ ?**

In general, if you're <100, that's pretty safe.  100-300 is still likely to get off the waitlist.  They move a lot with students dropping, and when TAs are confirmed, more spots are added to the class capacity. E.g. ML4T waitlist in the past (Fall 2018) has dropped by 500-600 spots

Examples:

* ML4T WL position 160: Pretty good
* IHI WL position 100: Pretty good
* GA WL position >= 500: You're better off trying for another class

**What is wait list drop day?**

If you can't get into a course by moving up the waitlist, you can take your chances on the deadline day for schedule and registration changes.  This deadline is the first Friday during the first week of classes.  On dday, waitlists drop around 8:30-9 am EST. This means waitlists disappear, and it becomes a battle royale for any free spots.  It is not worth it to refresh the courses page to wait for a spot to open.  By the time you do that and go register, the spot may be gone.  It's better to try registering for the course every minute (or however often you want to give time for).  If there was a spot, great, you're in. If not, the system won't enroll you. If you're already registered for two classes and are hoping to sneak into your desired 3rd class, then you must drop one of your registered classes before you can register for the 3rd class. Registration closes at 4p EST.

**What is the process for getting off the waitlist when a spot actually opens?**

An email will be sent out to your GaTech email when waitlists become active. They'll include some common FAQs. When you are low on the waitlist and a spot opens up for you, an email notification will be sent to you, and you have 12 hours to add the course. If you do not add the course in this time period, you'll be kicked to the bottom of the waitlist.",2018-11-09 06:05:37
Job outcomes for ML specialization graduates?,22,8qd9kq,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/8qd9kq/job_outcomes_for_ml_specialization_graduates/,18,1528752769.0,"Is there a place where the job outcomes for ML specialization graduates of OMSCS are reported?  Something like [\_This\_Link\_](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/undergrad/cscareers/placementreport) for CS undergrads/grad students at Cornell, although perhaps not quite so specific (and more aggregated) due to the sheer number of OMSCS grads.

The reason I ask is that I can't shake the feeling (not necessarily grounded in fact, which is why it's a ""feeling"") that a person with an MS in Computer Science just won't get the same level of respect as a person with an MS (never mind a PhD) in Statistics when it comes to looking for ML and Data Science jobs esp. when it comes to doing actual ML modeling.

Correct me if I'm wrong (and I very well could be), but it seems like the ""ceiling"" for a person with an MS in Computer Science\-\-\-even from a top school like GT\-\-\-is to be a SWE who happens to work on an ML team (or to be this in practice while being called an ""ML Engineer"") who spends most of the time taming Big Data and deploying ML models for production and tuning parameters as opposed to being the one actually conceiving/creating the models in the first place.  Because the ""edge"" that an average person with an MS in CS has over an average person with a graduate degree in Statistics is knowledge of distributed computing and wrangling with ""Big Data"" as opposed to the mathematical derivations and justifications that the Stats people are typically stronger in to actually create ML models.  Now, there is nothing wrong with this at all (being an ""ML Engineer"" sounds like a great job in and of itself), but I just wanted to make sure that a spade is called a spade.  I apologize if anything that I have said is woefully ignorant.

I commute each day to work for more than 2 hours each day. And since my hours are from 7-4 and filled with meetings, I had to do work outside of work hours to catch up. That along with gf and house work and driving my brother to swim practice and dropping him off at my parents hoise meant that O have about an hour each day to study lest I risk losing my sleep.

I thought I could take 2 classes I'm pretty well knowledgeable in and study during the weekend, but nah, more commitment coming up and I can only study Saturday morning and Sunday night.

Then I realized the courses had things I did not know that are interesting and like to learn more. But the number of projects, readings, and videos, not to mention keeping up with piazza result in me barely caught up every week.

I feel frustrated because I'm not able to deep dive and learn more about each topic besides what's presented.

PSA: Unable to log into Udacity with your GT account?

As best we can tell, this happens when the Google account was already associated with some other Udacity account.

If this happens to you, here are the steps that appear to resolve it:

1. Log out of Udacity entirely if you're logged in.
2. Go to the Udacity login screen.
3. Start the Forgot Password process.
4. For email address, put your Georgia Tech email address, but add +gt-udacity between the mailbox name and the @. For example, if my email address is david.joyner@gatech.edu, I would initiate a password reset for david.joyner+gt-udacity@gatech.edu.
5. Complete the password reset using the link in the email you receive.
 * If you don't receive a password reset email, repeat step 4, but this time use your username before the +: for example, djoyner3+gt-udacity@gatech.edu
6. Now, log into Udacity directly using the email address whose password you just reset.
 * This step might not actually be necessary.
7. Log out of Udacity entirely and attempt single-sign on again. This time, it should work.

If not, let me know! (Feel free to email me directly instead of emailing Udacity support -- david.joyner@gatech.edu. GT support emails get sent to me anyway, but it takes a day for them to get passed along, so emailing me directly bypasses the middleman.)

IIS : an amateurish feeling,18,83dtv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/83dtv1/iis_an_amateurish_feeling/,69,1520667861.0,"Hello,
I'm at the beginning of my OMSCS career and I would really like to understand whether it's actually worth it. I chose Intro to Information Security to begin with, because I wanted to start with a not-so-hard course (I didn't want to start with something overly difficult that I was unable to handle). The course is not difficult (I think I'm on track for an A) but there's another issue: it looks like it's it's run by amateurs, not by a Top 10 CS University in the US.

NOTE: this is a long list of nuisances with a BIG FINAL QUESTION. If you don't care about what's happening, but you have an opinion on my final question, feel free to skip the middle block :-)

Some examples:

- I encountered some errors, omissions, and imprecisions in the quizzes, those that you take ""at home"" with no time limit. I notified the TAs in a post on Piazza. One month passed, no feedback. The official rules say that you need to submit a regrade request for things, not piazza posts. But, guess what? There was no regrade request link  for such quiz, and it was impossible to get one.

- There seem to be repeated violations of the honor code by the professor and the TAs. Example: The Georgia Tech honor code states that the staff should ""Provide copies of old exams or lists of sample questions to the Georgia Tech library for Students to review"" and ""Avoid the re-use of exams"". We got absolutely no sample for the midterm exam, and the staff explicitly told us that they were unwilling to give us the answers we got wrong (!!!) because they were worried about question sharing, since such questions would be reused. But, as soon as you try speaking about a PAST quiz, project, or exam on Piazza or Slack, you are threatened because of honor code violations.

- About the exam above, with all the questions being reused, the exam was full of typos, imprecisions, questions from unassigned material, and other errors. I got a good score, but in some cases I was forced to guess about whether something was an error in the exam or it was a ""trap question"". Example : the question declared a thing like  ""Select which of those constraints apply to this access control system"". There were three actual constraints, and one additional feature which was indeed working for that access control system, but wasn't a constraint. I got that right, but I was forced to guess whether it was intentionally written that way, or it was an oversight and ""constraints"" was just a synonym for ""feature"". I hadn't seen such ""trap questions"" (questions with intentional errors) since high school, I hoped they were a thing of the past.

- After the exam, the staff made various mistakes on score upload which led to a storm of ""hey, my score is wrong"" requests on piazza (since there's no regrade request option).

- For project 2, we had to work on a course-provided website. When the project submission time expired, they took the site down. They provided us with our scores, the correct answers and opened the regrade window. But, since the project website is down, we're unable to see which questions we got wrong, making the regrade request pretty pointless.

- For the same project, it is pretty obvious to almost everyone that one of the points was plainly wrong and didn't work out like the website said (it was a 'vulnerability' working in Windows 9x, not in Windows XP, and we were working on XP). A student even recorded a screencast showing that was said in such point was impossible. On Slack, the TAs are stubbornly insisting (without showing the minimal proof, of course) that it was a 'vulnerability attempt' (we were required to mark even 'potential' vulnerabilities), even if the same course-provided writeup was saying something conflicting; it's clearly an error in the creation of the exercise. But, on piazza, no official written response has been issued for such question.

- On the latest project about public key cryptography there is a quite a huge ""bug"". They didn't realize that they tried to encrypt a message too small for the size of the public key, resulting in an easy to exploit vulnerability (called an nth-root vulnerability). But in they writeup they stated the messages were different and that we were to use a different attack (called a broadcast attack). A student reported that the TAs said we could use the ""easy"" attack implementation, but we should still discuss the full broadcast attack in our report in order to get full credit. This important info was written on Piazza by the student as a response! The TAs never thought it was important to tell the whole class about that, even if the mistake was theirs!

- When there's a question on Piazza that the TAs don't know how to address... they don't address it. No answer. Plain and simple. Potentially it's a mistake in a project or a quiz. So you get on Slack/Bluejeans during office hours...

- .. and, generally, the TAs seem to ""speak for themselves"" and seem to have little to no coordination with other TAs or the professor. You cannot trust their answers - when you get an answer. It has happened more than once that there was no answer.

- A lot of questions are highly subjective and you're often left wondering what they mean; you're called at answering things about the ""most important"" ""most useful""... a lot of adjectives.

**BIG QUESTION HERE:**
I'm doing the OMSCS to get a good grad education. Yes, I care a bit about the degree, but not so much. I care far more about my education. I'm not scared at a more difficult course, but I don't want to waste my time at fixing mistakes in a course where the TAs or the professors don't care. Sure, for IIS I decided that I won't care about such issues and go on, but it's not giving me a great impression.

That's the question in most of new student's minds. The answer is ""Most probably"". Keep reading  

Registration is some kind of game between the administration and students. The University tries to efficiently allocate limited resources (mostly TAs), and students try to get into the easiest/most popular classes from day one.  

Waitlists are the mechanism used to gauge and control the demand of classes. In an ideal world, students would only waitlist for the number of classes they are planning to take. However, many students waitlist for two, even three classes, and end up taking just one, inflating the real demand.  

As you may have noticed, registration extends until the end of the first week of classes. That means that in practice, many students are not registered (just waitlisted) when classes have started. Thus, students need to make a choice: a) Have peace of mind registering on their plan B or C class. b) Stay on the waitlist for their first choice class, and hope that spots appear until the last day of registration.  

Notice that the decision is completely up to you, but here are some useful guidelines and tips that you should keep in mind:  

- A good rule of thumb to know if a class is worth waitlisting: Take a look at the capacity it had last semester, and sum current capacity + waitlist size (you could consider an extra 10% tolerance due to churn/attrition). For example, last semester ML4T had a capacity of 550. Right now there are 245 registered and 200 on waiting list (445 students got there before you). So, if you get into the next 150 spots in the waiting list, you'll have high chances to register.  

- You need 10 classes to graduate. There are just like 4-5 very popular classes. So if it's hard to get in your first choice class, pick another one from your shortlist. Yes, it's probable that you'll have to get out of your comfort zone, but who said this was going to be easy? Sooner or later you'll have to brush up on statistics, linear algebra, learn a new programming language. It's better if you do it now rather than later when you are all burned out.  

- With all that said, if you look at the registration numbers from last semester you'll notice that all classes (except one) had remaining capacity > 0 at the end of registration. Why is that? As I said above, many students pick more classes that they really intend to take, and drop them at the last minute. The last day of registration, there's no waitlisting and many students drop, so if you definitely need to take some class and want to take the risk, you could try and grab a spot then.  


Last words: Use CRNs to register, it's easier. Don't forget that waitlisting is a two-step process, you need to reconfirm. If you are on a waitlist, keep an eye on your email (even better, activate notifications on your cell phone - yes, it's possible to use Oscar in mobile desktop).  

Good luck!",2017-08-14 12:51:21

My primary areas of interest are CS Theory and ML, though I'm more experience in the former. For CS Theory, I am specifically interested in algorithm design, graph theory, and combinatorial game theory. For ML, I'm interested in lots of things but have experience with social science modeling. Not very experienced at pure ML, though I know a lot of stats and linear algebra.

I currently have a project in graph algorithms I would happily collaborate with someone or someones on based on [this paper on tournament rigging](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/0038.pdf).

But the ignorant Human Resources department has a degrading or negative outlook on OMSCS applicants and filters online graduates.

Thoughts:

- Ignore that company

- Educate on-campus students to stop degrading online students (if true)

Here is the quote:

>My friend told me that in his company the HR will ask whether it is omscs or on-campus. Because there were gatech on-campus graduates explaining to HR that OMSCS requires ""no efforts at all"" and is a ""degree mill"". I spent so much efforts in the program and truly loved it.

In addition, here's a recent post from a recent thread in this subreddit:

>In regards to 5, it's great that GT doesn't make distinction, but as a local resident, I've attended some career fairs. Surprising number of recruiters (at least 80%) have asked if I am attending the program full-time or part-time, then when I say part-time, some of them (>= 25%) went on to ask if I am attending the program on-campus or online.

>The first question is common I guess given overlapping time in work and academic experience and if the recruiter actually looks at the resumes, but was surprised at the number of asking the second question. I have no idea whether they actually view the two differently inside their mind, but there does appear to be an increasing awareness regarding two different ""campuses"" for the degree.

I just want to share my history to the guys who are switching fields.
I'm an Electronics & Comms Engineer with a MS in Telecommunications Engineering Technology. I felt in love with Computer Science in 2015, AI and Data Science in particular. Since my country doesn't have a CS degree, I knew I had to search for an affordable way to get my MS (I did my MS in the US with a full ride scholarship so I didn't have the money to pay a MS in the US by myself).   

I was looking for an opportunity to switch fields and and I found this AWESOME program!!. Since then I've been studying Algo., python, etc... in order to be accepted into GT. After 2 years of studying and doing side projects, I got accepted to start in fall 2017. I had some family issues and I had to defer to spring 2018.

I was trying to find a job in either of these fields but I didn't have the credentials nor the XP nor projects to validate what I had learnt. I stopped looking and dedicated myself to the MS since day 1.

I decided to take DVA because:
a- ML4T was full;
b- the reddit posts, omscentral and the G+ community agreed that if you're starting with ML,
you should take DVA and/or ML4T before dive into ML;
c- I didn't know squatch about R.

I knew DVA was being revamped by Prof. Joyner, so I went there with optimism and willingness to learn. I'm not disappointed at all.  

While taking the class, I felt that I could use what I've learned on a Data Science position and then I started with the job hunting again. I gave it a shot, send my resume on March 15th and, lo and behold, got an interview to work in the BI & Analytics Dept. @TransUnion and after 2 weeks of exams and interviews, I got a job Offer!!

TLDR;

If you're switching fields, every class in the program counts!! Being part of a top 10 CS program without having massive debt while doing it sounds like crazy talk. This program is the BEST!!!",2018-03-30 08:40:45

What you should know before the first day of class...,16,3g58il,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/3g58il/what_you_should_know_before_the_first_day_of_class/,9,1438965017.0,"I see a lot of people here interested in applying but they have concerns about whether they have enough programming experience (or CS experience in general). The school admits a number of students who have strong backgrounds in math and sciences but little experience with CS. Some struggle, some excel. I wanted to create a post of free resources that I think would help applicants be ready for the program on day 1 if they don't have a good background.

Programming - You almost certainly will have to be comfortable with Java, and definitely with Python. Udacity (which also delivers the GaTech courses) has a couple of good introductory classes. For Python, Programming Foundations with Python is a good course, and for Java, Intro to Java Programming is solid. For more exposure to a broader range of concepts, I'd recommend Stanford's three course sequence that CS students take, available for free at: https://see.stanford.edu/Course. For some classes, C and/or C++ is required. I don't know of a lot of free tutorials for those, but wibit.net is a good one. You could finish the program without writing a line of C or C++ (unless you specialize in Computing Systems or High Performance Computing) so if you don't have time to learn those, prioritize learning Python and Java.

Algorithms - This is an area which you should take a few free Udacity courses before you start: Intro to Algorithms and Intro to Theoretical Computer Science. The GaTech graduate course covers both topics, and coming in with a solid understanding of the background material will help you tremendously. 

For certain classes, additional preparation will be needed. Many classes require you to use version control such as Git (Udacity: How to Use Git and Github). For Machine Learning, there is a good deal of math used, and the most efficient way to learn it is to look at the ML course at Stanford (link above) in which there is a review of math concepts that are helpful. 

There will be other challenges but based on my experience, with the above preparation, you can figure out the rest while you're in class.

one student's early impressions,16,1wtj1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/1wtj1e/one_students_early_impressions/,6,1391363700.0,"I am a current student in the first cohort of the OMSCS program enrolled in two classes (the maximum currently allowed). I have seen people asking about the rigor and experience of being in the program, so I thought I would take some of my very precious time to provide a bit of insight. I have a Bachelor's degree in computer science from a local state institution, which I feel prepared me adequately for graduate study. I took several graduate level courses as an undergraduate for elective credit and participated in research as an undergraduate, so the level of difficulty for the OMSCS classes is familiar to me.  In addition, I have worked full time as a software engineer for a handful of years. To top off the context, I am a very ambitious, self-driven individual with a cultivated sense of urgency about personal achievement and growth. I do not tolerate feelings of intellectual inferiority or failures to achieve personal goals. I use them to fuel longer hours and smarter work.

I was attracted to the OMSCS program because of its promise: a 100% online, fully accredited, Master's degree equivalent to the on-campus program from a very well-respected engineering school at a bargain price. I am happy to say that it is living up to that promise thus far. I find the courses to be as demanding as should be expected from both graduate-level study and an institution with GA Tech's reputation.

I am working full-time while taking these classes and balancing the demands on my time is a challenge. I have worked non-stop both nights and weekends since classes started and I feel like I am constantly behind on my studies. However, this is the state of affairs that I expected coming into the program. Given my personality, I feed off of this type of challenge, but I perfectly understand how some people would be overwhelmed by it.  That said, I am considering my options to shift my work-study balance to provide more time for studying and class work. I want to maximize my benefit from this program and I feel that doing so requires a change. If I could find time at work to read a few chapters or papers or even watch a few videos for school, then it would not be a problem. My day job is equally as intellectually and creatively demanding as my class work though, and there is rarely opportunity for any cross-over. Should I have a less demanding job, this would likely not be an issue.

There are a few points prospective students might want to consider prior to joining the program. First, the assignments thus far are very free-form with minimal requirements provided. This often reflects the state of software development in the real world, so its a familiar problem that I'm well-versed in overcoming and pertinent to teaching people what to expect as a working software developer. However, it also makes it very difficult to identify and achieve the necessary goals to make the grade and there does not appear to be any opportunity for refinement after a due date. Again, this can be very much like the working world with deadlines. Second, the amount of instruction given in the videos which pertains directly to the assignments is sometimes minimal. The basics may be taught or it may be assumed that you already know them and some sample code may be provided. However, an enormous amount of research and self-education is left up to the student. Yet again, this is very much like the real world where you are expected (and well-paid in many markets) to either know a solution to the problem or know how to find one quickly.

In general, there is nothing inherently wrong with these two points. They teach students what to expect as a practitioner and force students to develop the necessary skills to succeed. Just keep in mind that the majority of your education is likely to be self-taught as with any MOOC course, whether or not you are paying tuition and receiving credit for it.  Also, both of the classes that I am taking assume that you have a highly technical background (undergraduate computer science degree or equivalent experience) from the start and only one provides any sort of remedial refresher content.",2014-02-03 01:55:00

Given this semester is the first time the new format was used, I would like your opinion on the workload and what technologies I should familarize myself with before.

I know the course touches on a lot, but not sure how much prior knowledge I should have, probably D3 and JavaScript will be hard from what I read.

Also people have been saying it can take up to 40h/week so I am a bit worried.

The two reviews on Central seem to say the course is overambitious and overengineered, and they do not retain or learn much from it.

Preparing for Spring 2016!,14,3rghng,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/3rghng/preparing_for_spring_2016/,17,1446615158.0,"Spring 2016 is just a few more weeks (OK, months) away, and I can't help but feel the chills! I am starting to prepare for it, albeit a little bit too late. Are other guys doing so, too? Just to give you an idea, here are things I have done so far.

1. Completed Several Python classes in Coursera. They were quite a few months ago, the first may be already a year ago. Since I haven't used it outside of the classes, I do not still feel very confident so I just repeat things to gain confidence. Sorry for the not fans of rote studying.

2. Worked on the Udacity course on Health Informatics. After about half of the material though, I noticed that there are not so many problem sets and the likes. I feel that this should not be the case in the real classes, so I looked at the dashboard if I would encounter problem sets or exams later on. Voila, none. So I will start working on Machine Learning. Already looked at the dashboard, there are 3 problem sets and 3 projects. This may be a better practice.

3. Worked on http://www.freecodecamp.com/. I know that this is not C, Java, Python, or Matlab, but it is still coding practice. Plus I could have an output project afterwards which I think is neat. But after a 100 completed challenges and I am still on HTML and CSS, nah. I'm looking for alternatives now.

4. Worked on Head First Series Java (the book series with big heads on the cover). Find it entertaining. But same gnawing feeling as my other MOOCs where I seem to understand it, but will feel lost once I wade alone through it. Did I mention that I started as a Java developer last February? Yeah, I'm in for some disaster, err... challenge.

5. Not study part. Already negotiated with my husband about laptop use. We actually have one each, but my screen is better so he uses it for gaming. Since I am not very keen with it and his seems to be decent, we switched tools.

6. Read through and through about the program. I actually created the 2nd sheet in this file https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CkfZ0p5aFOX67RKALH_bwQ8Hpp6nJhcvKEjEp_cxLnk/edit#gid=0. Just can't get enough of it, so I decided to just fretting about it. But who am I kidding, one of these days I see myself scouring again through OMSCS-related sites.

7. I am practicing writing in English. Sorry for making you my unwitting victims. Reading is one thing (the easiest actually for me). Listening is another (I am OK with the usual audio speeds on Coursera and Udacity, but I sometimes cannot understand Sheldon on Big Bang). Don't get me started on speaking. I am not tackling that now. Maybe not in the near future.

I am pretty psyched on this! I would love to hear from others, too.",2015-11-04 13:32:38

> Machine Learning - Although the course is available on free Udacity, I'd actually recommend taking Thrun's ""Intro to Machine Learning"" on Udacity instead. It will help you get a good feel and also has a project attached to it. It is also good to know Java for the second project as you are given code in Java. If you want to explore the use of R, ""Data Analysis with R"" on Udacity would be a good option as well. And if you have never taken a statistics course (my CS undergrad didn't require it somehow), take ""Intro to Descriptive Statistics"" and ""Intro to Inferential Statistics"" on Udacity.

"Waitlists and notifications of open spots in courses will begin on Friday (tomorrow), per the OMSCS Advising Team.",14,ac9ais,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/ac9ais/waitlists_and_notifications_of_open_spots_in/,6,1546544405.0,"**This text is from an email sent by the advising team.  I am not a member of this team, I am a student.  Just sharing the info.**

---------------------------------------------

Hello OMSCS Students!

 

As a reminder, wait lists will become active and notifications will start going out on Friday, January 4.  Please be sure to monitor your GT email account closely and frequently so that you do not miss your wait list notification, if you receive one.

 

Please keep in mind the following about wait lists:

If you need to know how to add yourself to a wait list, please follow the directions on the Registrar’s website (https://registrar.gatech.edu/registration/waitlists).  Be sure to confirm that you have waitlisted for your course by checking your ""Student Detail Schedule"".  Please do NOT email our office asking for confirmation, as we will redirect you to this email.
We are continuing to move Spring 2019 degree candidates (who applied by our departmental deadline) up on the wait lists.  This means that your wait list position may have changed or will change.  
***You only have 12 hours to add the course after you receive the waitlist notification.***
Once you receive the wait list notification, you must add by CRN.  Add by ""look up"" does not work for waitlisted courses.
If you do not register within the 12-hour period, you will be dropped from the wait list, and the next person on the list will receive permission to enroll.  We have no control over this.  If this happens, your only option is to add yourself back to the wait list and hope for the best.
Even once the wait lists are active, your total number of enrolled + waitlisted hours should never be more than six hours.
Please note that there are two different reasons why you might be issued a waitlist notification:  either we have added seats to a course or someone else dropped the course and released the seat.  We can control when we add seats, but we cannot control when someone else drops.  If you receive a waitlist notification at midnight, it is because someone else dropped the course at that time, and we cannot control that. 
If you change your mind about a course you are waitlisted/enrolled in, you have to remove yourself.  We cannot remove you.  Additionally, we cannot add students to a wait list or a course — you must add yourself.  PLEASE make sure to remove yourself from ANY wait list you do not need if you get into the course(s) you want.
 

If a Course/Wait List is Closed:

 

Please keep in mind that Phase II registration does not end until 4:00pm ET on Friday, January 11.  Therefore, please continue monitoring the course/wait list until that timeframe to see if a spot becomes available.

 

FAQs:

 

Q:  I missed my wait list notification.  What do I do now?

A:  The only thing you can do is get back on the wait list and hope for the best, or select another course.

 

Q:  I am a Spring 2019 degree candidate, and I need X course(s) to complete my degree requirements.  What do I do?

A:  We will make certain that every degree candidate who applied by our departmental deadline gets into the specialization course(s) that he/she needs to complete his/her degree requirements.  Be sure to get on the wait list as soon as possible, and monitor your account closely and frequently for a wait list notification.

 

Q:  I am a Spring 2019 degree candidate, but I have not applied to graduate yet.  Will I get bumped?

A:  You will not get bumped if you did not apply for graduation by our departmental deadline.

 

Q:  I plan to graduate at the end of the Summer 2019 semester, but I cannot register for the course(s) I need to graduate.  Can I receive priority on the wait list for the course if it is not offered during the summer semester?

A:  We unfortunately cannot guarantee that potential Summer 2019 degree candidates will be prioritized on the wait lists for specialization courses they need that are not offered during the summer semester, as we need to prioritize our Spring 2019 degree candidates during Phase II registration.  However, as a potential Summer 2019 degree candidate, you are welcome to send a message to oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu and include your full name, your nine-digit GT ID number (90X-XX-XXXX), and the name of the course you would like to enroll in, and we will do our best to assist you with being prioritized on the wait list if there are seats still available after our spring degree candidates have enrolled.

 

Q:  How can I see my wait list position?

A:  The best way for a student to check his/her wait list number is from the ""Student Detail Schedule"" section of OSCAR.  Instructions on how to do this are included in the Spring 2019 Orientation document (available online at http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/online-ms-cs/omscsportal).

 

Q:  What if I still do not get in a course after seats are added?

A:  It is highly likely that more seats will be added to most classes as more TAs are identified and hired.  Again, please continue monitoring the course/wait list, as advisors cannot predict if/when additional seats will be added.

 

Q:  Will everyone on the wait lists get in/will more seats become available?

A:  Please note that just because wait lists become active, that does not mean everyone on a wait list will get a notification to register for the course.  This only happens when a seat becomes available in the course.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee that everyone on every wait list will get in.  Some classes are unable to scale above a certain max and still provide an effective learning experience for students.  Please note that the advisors are unable to determine/predict which courses will have more seats added.

 

Q:  What are my chances of getting into a specific course and/or wait list?

A:  We strive to give all students an opportunity to register for a variety of courses.  However, advisors cannot predict if/when a course may have more seats added or if a wait list will be expanded, nor can we predict the chances a student has of enrolling in a specific course from the wait list.  Our best advice is to continue monitoring the course(s) you are interested in taking and/or the wait list(s) for those courses.

 

Q:  What does X registration error mean?

A:  If you are trying to register for a course, and you receive an error message, please refer to the following link for an explanation of what the error message means:  https://registrar.gatech.edu/registration/error-messages.

 

As a reminder, if you receive the “CAMPUS RESTRICTION” error message, this is because you are attempting to enroll in a course that is not part of the OMS CS program.  Most OMS CS courses will have a section of “O” (example: O01, O02, etc.).  Courses with the “OAN” section are for OMS Analytics students only, and courses with the “OCY” section are for OMS Cybersecurity students only – OMS CS students are NOT permitted to enroll in these sections.

 

Q:  I am registered for my course, but I cannot seem to access the course materials.  What do I do?

A:  Course materials will be available sometime during the first week of classes (anytime between January 7 and 11).  Unfortunately, we do not have control over when course materials will be available, nor do we have any additional information as to exactly when course materials will be available.  You also can refer to the student-run OMS CS Google + webpage (https://plus.google.com/communities/108902554607547634726) as a way to see if other students have received access to their course materials.  If you register for a course during the first week that classes begin, please note that it can take up to 24 hours before you can access your course materials.  If after this period of time you still cannot access your course materials, please contact GTech-support@udacity.com.

 

Reminder:  The Google+ OMSCS Community (https://plus.google.com/communities/108902554607547634726) is an awesome resource, but please note that it is not the official forum for communication from our office.

 

Again, if you have any questions regarding this information, please be sure to direct them to oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu and include your full name and nine-digit GT ID number (90X-XX-XXXX).

 

Enjoy the rest of your week!

I have four years of experience as a full-time web developer (plus one year as a team lead / manager), but I have no formal education or foundation in computer science and software programming (I have a BA in neuroscience and a Masters in science journalism). I am interested to see what else is out there in this industry, as the vast majority of my time as a dev has been spent building Angular web apps. To that end, I am currently taking a break from work to attend the Recurse Center (which has been awesome), but I am curious about how I can best keep my education going. I am currently learning Rust, which has forced me to learn about compilation, types, memory management, and other key concepts that I didn't come across much (or at all) as a front end developer. I am also interested in data visualization (and other parts of working with data), graphical programming and it's potential applications in education technology, computational science, health informatics and other ways that I can bring my coding skills back in the direction of science, health, or journalism/presentation of information.

I can take random MOOCs to fulfill these interests, but the Interactive Intelligence specialization for OMSCS looks to cover most or all of those areas. On top of that, I like the prospect of getting feedback and having deadlines while doing these classes. So, it seems to me this program would offer me the chance to get a sense of a number of different areas in the field, and that after 3 years or so, I'd be in a significantly stronger position to take a new direction in my career (or go deeper in whatever I'm doing at the time).

For those of you who are in the program or have finished, do you find this program helped get you where you want to be as a computer scientist / software developer?",2018-06-20 02:52:23

standards getting lower in oMSCS?,13,5sxnpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/5sxnpr/standards_getting_lower_in_omscs/,87,1486611221.0,"So I've read a few posts here regarding this program and it's non traditional form of accepting people with little to no CS background.  In one of my classes, there is a homework that asks students to describe the growth rates of some functions, written recursively and iterative form. It also asks to state the time complexity of each function. However, its clear now that after receiving the grades, a portion of the class didn't quite grasp the concept that growth rates and time complexity means that you need to describe Big O or something related.  So as a result, we have a bombardment of piazza posts of people whining about how they didn't understand it was big O,  what's time complexity..etc,  and how the diversity of the program means that assignment description should be in basic dumbed down terms  

Now I'm not trying to overreact or sound condescending to people without CS backgrounds, but sometimes I feel that the quality just isn't there with this program.  I have a feeling that because of this outrage going on in piazza and this potentially occurring in other courses, they might dumb these assignments down even further to accommodate the ""diverse students"" 
I'm not saying that they need to rejected people from non CS backgrounds to this program. I'm suggesting that they have a requirement of the GRE so that mathematical and analytical skills can be factored into the admissions process.   I also have a feeling that OMSCS is becoming more of a money maker due the vast amount of ""diverse"" people in the program.  I understand the process is that they select people that they think that will succeed instead of just 15%, but how do you select people without comprising your standards. ",2017-02-09 11:33:41

I have just withdrawn from OMSCS. I may try again next semester (LONG POST).,13,3kk3fi,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/3kk3fi/i_have_just_withdrawn_from_omscs_i_may_try_again/,39,1441988110.0,"I'm sure professors and administration will be able to tell who I am from this post. That is fine. I apologize if my frustration leads the tone of this post to become whiny and unprofessional. If that happens, I hope you will be able to be a bigger person than me, look past the whining and find something constructive that can come of this.

I have a genuine frustration with the program. It is not my intention to bash the program because I think it's an outstanding idea, outstanding effort, imperfection is expected and I want it to succeed. My hope is that administration will take this seriously.

I used to be a teacher, taught Information Technology, and often took online courses with my local college (one of the 10 largest postsecondary institutions in the USA) for certification and recertification purposes. 

Like any other online program, OMSCS is geared towards working professionals. We have families, jobs and lives outside of OMSCS. We expect OMSCS to become a large part of our lives over the next couple of years.

We understand and expect courses to be rigorous and time-consuming. For this reason, we still have to plan carefully and set aside specific time to work on our coursework. Our time is limited and we are making personal sacrifices to spend this time and money (as cheap as the tuition is, $1300-1400 per semester is still not pocket change).

This means professors and TA's have to respond to and resolve issues quickly. I understand this is a huge challenge but it's not an option, it's a requirement for running an online course. One of my course's instructors were very much engaged, which was nice. 

In the other course, I knew I'd have to work especially hard, but I was prepared to do whatever work was necessary. 

We were given a primer course that we were to complete during Drop-Add period to determine if we should stay in the course. This was very important to me because I knew I had not seen a couple of the topics before.

I am very familiar with Linux/UNIX, C programming, etc. that we needed to know but two of the topics I had never seen. Unfortunately for me, those two topics happened to be inaccessible to me, and to much of the class.

The first week of class, about a half-dozen of us reported this to the Instructors. By the end of Drop/Add there was still no resolution. Perhaps I should have dropped at this point, but I figured, ""Very few probably are experts in every area covered... I have a Computer degree... I'm a long-time IT professional... there are non-Computer majors in this program... I must be at least somewhat prepared to take this class, even if I have to work a good bit harder."" 

So I ended up banging my head against the wall, trying to understand these concepts, trying to do my projects, but crucial materials provided by the professor were nonfunctional and we were explicitly forbidden from collaboration. Which with all due respect, is a restriction I disagree with **strongly** (again, I say this as a former high school Information Technology teacher who is fully aware of the risk of cheating. Having a concept explained by a colleague, running something by a colleague when you hit a wall, is crucial in the Computing Sciences -- other than exams I think forbidding collaboration in a CS class is misguided -- again, with all due respect).

I have an entire IT career predicated on knowing how to get to the bottom of how poorly documented technologies work, why they are failing, etc., but I could find *nothing* to help me with the particular struggles I was having. There were questions where I did not even know where to begin looking... and again: I was forbidden from seeking assistance from fellow students, and the instructors were not responding to my requests for help.

Several more times, I and other students posted to Piazza seeking resolution, including earlier this week. No response, no resolution. So Wednesday morning, I finally e-mailed my professor directly, apologizing for doing so. I still as of today have received no response. I realize people are busy, but with an online class, responses have to be within a couple of hours, not a couple of days -- let alone four weeks (which is how long the instructors have known about these issues).

The additional time I've had to spend on this one course trying to find resources, etc. has set me behind where I needed to be, so I withdrew completely from the semester and am deciding whether or not to start anew next semester and being much more selective regarding the classes I take.

**EDIT: Several of you have figured it out so I'll go ahead and acknowledge, yes, it was CS 6290, High Performance Computer Architecture**. I appreciate several of you who have responded or PMed with similar experiences; I've been beating myself up over it and it's good to know I'm not alone.

Ideal Sequence of Classes for ML Specialization?,12,a4mtm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/a4mtm7/ideal_sequence_of_classes_for_ml_specialization/,26,1544377195.0,"Hi all,

First semester is this coming spring. I come from a non-cs engineering background and am interested in the ML specialization.

Currently I am using this link to plan my course order:

To summarize, with the knowledge that I won't get into GA until the end of the program, this person recommends taking courses in this order:

GA -> AI4R -> AI -> ML4T -> DVA -> ML -> RL 

and then I may take CV somewhere in there, and throw BD4H onto the end.

The general theory behind this persons outline is that the initial courses better cover the math that you will need throughout the specialization and more slowly introduce you to the languages and libraries.

I'm curious if others who have taken many of these courses have similar or different recommendations of course order and why?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If you think the course order doesn't matter between classes you could use ( ). I.e. GA -> (AI4R, AI, ML4T) -> DVA -> ML -> RL or something.

I'm looking at a lot of courses for the machine learning and AI specializations, but so many of them list heavy mathematical prerequisites. It seems like I could do the computing systems specialization courses, but that kind of feels like the easy way out. I don't want to take the easy way out because then what's the point of this all, but I feel like I don't have the math background to be able to succeed in something like ML or Computer Vision.

Most of the classes I've taken so far have certainly required a degree of learning the prerequisites on the go. Learning C, networking, low level operating system stuff, etc. But I don't think I'll be able to teach myself linear algebra or calculus on the go while balancing the actual classwork.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation to me? What did you do? What are your thoughts on the math required for these classes? Does anyone have any advice? Will it hurt me to settle for computing systems? I'm definitely learning stuff in the computing systems major, but will I be at a disadvantage in the industry by not doing the ML or AI specializations?

https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/6x6o03/how_strict_is_the_4_year_undergraduate_degree_or/

https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/6wbjqu/can_i_apply_now_even_though_my_undergraduate/

I thought maybe (1) was because I did a maths degree instead of computer science degree, but I have a large amount of professional experience, and furthermore did 6 comp-sci units and 3 logic units in my maths degree anyway. Surely that's not the reason.

The (2) objection is surely irrelevant - I'm from Australia, with English as my first language, so I shouldn't have to sit TOEFL as discussed here:

On Incessant Trivial Questions on Piazza,13,5sp9di,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/5sp9di/on_incessant_trivial_questions_on_piazza/,23,1486512806.0,"I've noticed that my Piazza pages are filled with trivial questions like, ""Can I use this or that tool?"" or ""Can I submit files from the VM?"" or ""Can the submitted files contain extra new lines?"" or ""Can the TAs confirm that only such and such files are to be submitted?"" or other equally heart-breaking questions. These questions are so draining mentally and resource-wise (I applaud the TAs for having the patience to answer them). 


However, while they can be annoying, I don't blame the students for asking really, except for questions on things that are obviously redundant or have been stated explicitly in the assignment write-ups. With a class as big as the ones I'm currently in, the TAs have probably automated the crap out of everything, and often the penalties for not conforming to their requests can be severe: large deductions for having the wrong file name or for causing TAs' scripts to fail because the student's submitted program prints out extra lines, etc. 


Slowly, we've created a culture that fosters paranoia and panic attacks. I feel that this is a lose-lose proposition for both the students and TAs, and yet I don't quite have any suggestions on how to fix it. I understand both sides. I was in a traditional graduate program a couple of years ago, and none of these things happened, and the TAs were much, much more lenient on trivial things.

Anyway, I thought I'd share my thoughts. Please share your opinions, experiences, or suggestions!",2017-02-08 08:13:26

Right now I'd like to start my first semester with either Machine Learning or GA. What would be the best pairing for one of these? I'd avoid GA but I really think I ought not to try and sidestep something like that since it is important in my job and I kinda cheesed the algorithms course in undergrad.

 The shitty UI makes it hard to do so quickly, so i wrote up this JS snippet you can paste in your browser console.

```js
Array.from(document.getElementById('subj_id').options).forEach(opt => opt.selected = ['CS', 'CSE'].includes(opt.value))
Array.from(document.getElementById('camp_id').options).forEach(opt => opt.selected = ['O'].includes(opt.value))

OMSCS without a math background?,11,9yno3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/9yno3j/omscs_without_a_math_background/,24,1542680333.0,"I got my undergrad in Econ in 2014, I made it through Calc 1 and Econometrics (multivariate regression) but haven't done much math since I graduated.

&#x200B;

Since then, I've taught myself Python and several flavors of SQL. I landed a job as a data analyst at Big N company, and I'm TA'ing a data analytics bootcamp at a major university. I also have experience with several big data tools (Hadoop, AWS) and have done a little webdev. I'm definitely pursuing a career in data science, and am planning on using the degree to further this pursuit (although I'm becoming more and more interesting in the data engineering side as I learn about it).

&#x200B;

My biggest concern is my lack of advanced math. I've never studied linear algebra or Calc 2+. I'm about to apply for the Fall 2019 term. My plan is to take a break from TA'ing after this semester ends so I have more time to study these topics (and probably Big O Notation) in preparation.

&#x200B;

I'm also concerned (although less so) about my lack of experience with lower level/compiled languages. I've been thinking about picking up Java to fill this gap, but I'm not sure where my time would be best spent.

&#x200B;

Do you think I'll be in over my head if I enroll next fall? Do you think I can even get in?

&#x200B;

Do you think my expectations to study up on these topics enough to be prepared in the next \~11 months or so are realistic?

&#x200B;

Should I focus more on beefing up my math or programming before the program starts?

&#x200B;

Is this degree totally wrong for someone pursuing a career in data?

Sharing time: OMSCS vs life,10,97zvua,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/97zvua/sharing_time_omscs_vs_life/,26,1534486346.0,"While discussing schedule disruptions and project extensions in another thread, I realized OMSCS students have to give up a lot to make this work.  I thought I'd start a thread of examples to scare future students, to serve as a release valve, to laugh about, to commiserate, to feel better that each of us is not alone in this difficulty, to show who had the best/worst, or whatever.

Here's my list:

- Due to sister's wedding and visiting family, did not get to watch lectures and study until midway through the second week (about 10 days of missed schedule).  On my first semester ever after being away from school for 20+ years.  Next 3-5 weeks were just surviving.  I immediately had to use the free-drop assignment in AI, when both AI (#2 homework) and RL (#1 project) had deadlines on the same day (got AI to 65% when I decided to focus on RL).  This free-drop early in the semester meant every single remaining AI assignment had to be done.  Most people enjoyed their free time on the last assignment, while I toiled for points.

- Sick kid during week leading up to due dates.  Had to sacrifice RL on last week of semester because it and AI again had the same due date.  Submitted AI without completing last problem.  Took a one-day 20% penalty on RL, and did not finish anyway (another 15% points lost).

- Suddenly sick kid to ER (different semester/course).  Was on course to finalize and submit with enough time.  Couldn't submit while waiting for medical tests.  Asked for extension of 4 hours the following day just to submit.  Granted another 24 hours.  Sent ER medical record as proof.

Now, I am going home (international) for sick mom right about start of classes.  So first two weeks I'll be maybe in and out of hospital, and maybe when my mindset is right, watch a lecture or two.  I am bringing my laptop and the Hammack book (hopefully can get into GA).

I'm sure you guys and gals have at least a couple of coding sessions at hospitals after baby, or at home after long bouts of baby care.  Or a tough work week, or an impossible travel schedule.  Can't wait to hear how everyone is fairing.",2018-08-17 14:12:26

My first semester catharsis,10,5fmrzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/5fmrzw/my_first_semester_catharsis/,21,1480469973.0,"I wanted to finish this degree before I turned 27, mainly for reasons of pride, but I don't think that's reasonable- and I'm glad. I would be looking at two class semesters of more challenging courses with at _least_ a three credit semester for the next year and a half if I wanted to stay on that track.

This semester I took database theory and KBAI. On their own, both classes offered great value to me, as well as my career. My biggest regret is not being as fully immersed in either subject due to the required effort among both classes. There were many concepts from database theory that I would have liked to have practiced more to apply to my daily job (relational algebra/ calculus for example). KBAI provided introspection into how we approach problem solving, and codifying the process. We explored reasoning systems that were genuinely interesting, and I even had a paper selected as exemplary. I will most likely pull and A and a B at the end, respectively. 

I had an idea of what I was getting into when singing up for both classes my first semester, but I did not imagine to what extent. This semester I put a strain on my  relationship, family,  and friends just to pull through.

I remember times of feeling bitter not being able to work on career related side projects or certifications because of my course load, or take a trip to that tech conference. 

I am looking to just take one course next semester and use that freed up time to immerse myself further into my course studies, pursue more career opportunities and side projects, and reclaim some sanity by spending a bit more time with friends and family.

I definitely learned the hard way this semester, but it was definitely a valuable lesson.",2016-11-30 09:39:33

For those of you who've been in similar situation as me, or is currently in my shoes (using OMSCS to get that first CS job), I have a few questions.

1) Did you think OSMSCS prepares/prepared you well for a FT job or are the classes a bit too specialized?

2) How is the job search like? I assume it is a bit more difficult than a traditional undergrad program since there won't really be any career fair, job boards, and networking events. Any tips? Did you mainly apply to online job boards?

3) Given that this program is part time and meant for the working adults, were you looking for full time SWE jobs during the program or did you treat it like a traditional full time Masters program?

4) Any other tips/advice? Since OMSCS is not a traditional program and most people here are already employed I'm a bit nervous going into this program since I couldn't find much data on how people like myself do after/during the degree",2018-09-10 08:24:28

Non-CS undergrad - looking to strengthen CS Fundamentals,11,92hjbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/92hjbp/noncs_undergrad_looking_to_strengthen_cs/,13,1532734505.0,"Firstly thank you everyone for making this such a great space to offer and seek help - you all have been great.

**tl;dr - What are good ways to learn CS fundamental for non-CS undergrad?**

I'm a Non-CS undergrad (Mechanical Engr - Mechatronics) in OMSCS since Spring '18 - taken Computer Networks so far. Background: I took the Udacity Full Stack course a couple of years ago and through some luck found a python developer job at a company desperate for someone (my interview was a simple phone-call - can you code in Python, and can you do Django/Linux - ok, you're hired.) The job itself is relatively simple with maintaining and modifying legacy code - I had to get my foot in the industry so I took the job.

With intentions of getting more concrete experience, I've been looking to make a shift into a proper CS/developer job but I'm finding during interviews that I'm lacking some CS fundamentals - all jobs postings also highlight CS fundamentals as a requirement. I know the huge emphasis on data structures, and algorithms - I'm learning those using HackerRank and LeetCode. Having talked to an associate, he stated that I wouldn't have been having this issue if I had a CS undergrad - he discounted the fact that I'm getting a masters in CS, saying that wouldn't cover the underlying basics.

With this in mind, what OMSCS classes do you suggest for someone like me to gain a solid understanding of the fundamentals. Additionally are there any external resource or books that provide good coverage of the CS fundamentals.

Doing some quick searching I keep finding mentions of classes like:

* Harvard's CS50
* MIT's 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python
* Udacity - Intro to CS

Do theses classes cover the basics or are they too rudimentary and need to be supplemented further?

Many others have many questions about per-quisite classes for OMSCS so I'll keep this brief. I'm a chemical engineer with several MOOCs in computer science but I would not say I have a strong CS credential.

Western Governors University recently open up BS in Computer Science, **I'm trying to decide if I want to attend WGU to get a BS degree first**. What's your thought? 

The [WGU BSCS degree](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/computer-science.html) includes the following courses included in their core courses that have been mentioned in here on this subreddit as ""necessary"" for successful application to OMSCS

- Computer Architecture
- Data Structures and Algorithms I
- Data Structures and Algorithms II
- Discrete Mathematics I 
- Discrete Mathematics II
- Computer Architecture
- Operating Systems for Programmers 

WGU advertise themselves as competency based, and I can finish the whole BS as quickly as 6 months if I transfer all my credits from chemical engineering into them. Their 6 months costs $3500 approximately. Additionally, their transcript shows a pass fail (passing equivalent to 3.00, all passing student receives 3.00). 

A bit about me if you are curious.
I'm a chemical engineer with several MOOCs in computer science but I would not say I have a strong CS credential. I recently transitioned into Software Engineering but I would like to advance further into computer science (more than just coding). I would like to have a deeper understanding (hopefully ability apply the knowledge) in Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data, AI etc. instead of just hearing buzz words. Another BS in CS does not provide me this experience. On the practical side, why learn this? I think it's fun and having a nice job is fun too.

## Admissions requirements per the OMSCS admissions site:

*Preferred qualifications for admitted OMS CS students are an undergraduate degree in computer science or related field (typically mathematics, computer engineering or electrical engineering) from an accredited institution with a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher. Applicants who do not meet these criteria will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis; however, work experience will not take the place of an undergraduate degree. The following are required for admission:*

* *Evidence of award of a 4-year bachelor's degree or its equivalent (prior to matriculation) from a regionally accredited institution, demonstrated academic excellence and evidence of preparation in their chosen field sufficient to ensure successful graduate study*

* *For international applicants, satisfactory scores on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)*

How are you pacing yourselves?,11,6vrf35,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/6vrf35/how_are_you_pacing_yourselves/,26,1503586963.0,"I'm curious how the current students are (and I guess how the former students were) pacing themselves through the program, i.e., how many classes per semester are/were you doing in general?

I started with 2 in spring 17, NetSec and CCA, but ended up withdrawing from both because I had too many external obligations whose time requirements I severely underestimated.  I probably could've made it through either of those classes individually but I messed that up from the beginning.  No regrets since in retrospect I'm not sure I'd want to use one of my ten classes on NetSec.

Summer was one class, AI4R, because still being a noob I'm limited to only one over the summer.  Now I'm in IOS and CV with significantly fewer external obligations.  I can definitely handle the workload for those two this semester but I'm still strongly considering dropping one so that I can maximize my effort and so that I can still have time available outside of work and OMSCS.  And there seems to be a common theme of ""you get out of it as much as you put into it"" for a lot OMSCS courses.  I'm not in a huge hurry to finish this program and I would like to make these courses as worthwhile as possible for me.  So I might just end up doing one per semester anyway, even when I take the ""easy"" classes.

Looking for course Suggestions to round out ML/AI focused curriculum,9,86tmp3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/86tmp3/looking_for_course_suggestions_to_round_out_mlai/,11,1521904476.0,"Hello All,


I'm trying to plan out my class schedule for my remaining semesters and am hoping you all here may have some insight.  As background, I did my BS in engineering and work for a semiconductor manufacturer. I write software that maintains a database of historical manufacturing settings/results and uses the data plus some logic/math to make decisions about what settings to use in the future.  From this work I'm well versed in databases, SQL, R, C#, statistics, and linear algebra.  There's not a strong software culture there so I don't have experience with good practices for software development process, testing, or analysis.


My goal after finishing this program is to get a job as a machine learning or data science practitioner in NYC.


I'm in my second semester and so far have taken:

Artificial Intelligence

Computational Photography

Machine Learning for Trading

Computer Vision


I've decided to complete the machine learning specialization so in addition I'm planning to take:


Reinforcement Learning

Machine Learning

Big Data for Health

Graduate Algorithms


That leaves two remaining classes to figure out.  If I were to choose based solely on personal interest I'd go all in on the ML/AI classes and take KBAI and AI4R, but I'm wondering if taking some of the computing systems classes would be more useful.  IHPC, HPCA, SDP, SAT, and SAD are the ones I might guess could be helpful but I'm open to suggestions.  I'm aware of OMSCentral so I know which classes are well rated; I'm more asking about the overall composition of the curriculum I build.


Any and all input is appreciated.


Thanks,

Ian

What are your favorite OMSCS courses?  What are the most worthwhile courses to take at OMSCS?

My favorite classes have been ~ ML4T > IS/NS/SDP > CN (CN was not the class it is today).

However, this semester I am enrolled in the Database Systems course, and I have had to spend most of my time (and a lot of it) on things that are not specific to learning DB material.  In addition, DB Systems and Concepts are probably topics I could learn through other avenues and maybe my time would've been better spent on a course that is more worthwhile to take at OMSCS... i.e.""If you are an OMSCS student, you really should take class X""

I've checked omscentral but some classes seem to lack recent reviews, so hoping students could share their recommendations on most worthwhile courses to take at OMSCS based on recently experiences.  I do not have a specific goal while I'm here, I am really here for continued education and bonus points for practical knowledge.  Planning to take IOS next fall, but have a few more classes to choose and a little time to decide if I want to stick with Computer Systems (still have to take GA...)  or switch to Interactive Intelligence.

"first semester, 5 weeks in reflections",9,71vykq,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/71vykq/first_semester_5_weeks_in_reflections/,25,1506136662.0,"Greetings all.  This is maybe part reflection, part rant.  I just feel rather discouraged now.


This is my first semester.  During the registration frenzy, I looked through the options of classes that I thought'd I'd be able to get in to.  The class that sounded most interesting and I had the best odds of getting in to was IOS.  I also wait listed for ML4T.  The wait list was filled but somehow I still got in during the last day of registration.  I debated whether or not to drop at that point but I figured I would give it a shot.  What do I have to lose?  


This semester started off well.  My plan was to just work as part time as possible to pay bills and allocate the rest of my free time to coursework.  It has been nonstop work since the semester started, learning both C and Python and I found the subject material of both classes to be engaging and interesting.


Things were going well thus far.  We have had two ML4T projects, both of which I was able to get 100% on.  The IOS projects seemed to be going well too.  Everything appeared to work on my machine.  That soon quickly changed once I submitted the early parts of the project to the online grader.  IOS uses a program called ""bonnie"" to grade your work.  Bonnie is unforgiving.  Things that appear to work fine on your own system (running both client and server software locally) do not work so well in the wild.  To be clear, bonnie is a part of the learning experience and of which, I have learned a lot.  There were a few parts that I got rather stuck on and the positive is that, through hard work, determination and help from classmates and TAs, I have been able to get nearly all of the test cases to pass.


While the first IOS project was released right at the beginning of the semester, the first two ML4T projects were both released about two weeks before they were due.  I can't recall exactly when the current ML4T project was released, but the official reddit thread was posted 8 days ago.  I kept chugging along on my IOS project because at that point, I was really worried about not completing it.  Part 1 had taken a long time to complete.  There were a few issues that were causing nearly all test cases to fail and took a couple days to resolve.   Part 2 was easy by comparison and only took me a day to complete.


The IOS project is due Sunday PM, the ML4T project is due Monday PM.  All in all, I should have had about 25 to 30 hours for the ML4T project.  My plan of action today was to rise early and work on the ML4T project, which is to implement different types of learners from scratch.  I went over the project description, requirements, rewatched lectures relevant to the task at hand and began my implementation.  About early afternoon I was stuck.  I was trying to figure out how to incorporate the Y data in to the X data ndarray, since the array will need to be sorted (i also could have been going at it all wrong).  At about 5 pm I was starting to lose hope.  Today is Friday and I work both Saturday and Sunday from 2pm until 10:30pm.  That would give me the mornings of both days and Monday to wrap it up.  I had anticipated that I might need more time, so I had been checking with coworkers to see if anyone could cover my shifts this weekend.  Or maybe I call in to work and tell them I won't be coming in this weekend.  


I think I have decided that I will drop ML4T and hopefully finish strong in IOS.  I feel confident in my grade in IOS is better at this point considering I have that project nearly completed, than turning in the ML4T project that I am not even sure if I build something that barely works in this time frame.


TL;DR  started strong, hit a wall in a project, feel like I should drop a class.

Advice for New Students,10,3cob30,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/3cob30/advice_for_new_students/,10,1436449048.0,"I wanted to start a thread so that current students can give advice to those who are beginning the program this fall. I am really enjoying my time in the program and wanted to offer the following suggestions for courses to take:

Start the program with 6250 and/or 6300 (if possible) - These are two of the less intense courses and they will give you an idea of what to expect from the program without overwhelming you. They use Python (6250) and Java (6300) and you also get practice with Git.

Take 7637 next for more programming practice - This is the most well-run course I have taken. It involves mainly solving problems with code, which is a lot of fun. I am not particularly interested in AI yet I still find the course enjoyable. You can use Java or Python for the projects.

Take 6505 as early as you can - If your concentration requires it, you should plan to take it as soon as you can get in the course. More than half of people who start the course either drop or don’t earn a grade high enough to count it towards their concentration. By taking it early, you give yourself an opportunity to take it twice (if needed) or to change to another concentration that doesn’t require it.  

A lot of these classes fill up, but you can put yourself on the waitlist and likely get in the course. ",2015-07-09 21:37:28

I got my BS in Biomedical Engineering in 2013. 3.89 GPA, math and physics minors, several courses requiring programming knowledge (Java, Matlab, Fortran, LabVIEW, R), but no CS specific courses. I currently work for the federal government as a patent examiner and my programming skills have rusted due to neglect. Frustrated with federal salary caps and lack of room for career growth, I have decided to persue computer science. 


My Dilemma:


I'm applying for Spring 2020 matriculation and trying to figure out who to ask for recommendations. My former manager (now peer after a recent promotion) would write a great recommendation and my current supervisor would write a decent one. Neither of them can attest to my CS credentials. I am lucky enough to work with several of my old professors every year as a member of my university's BME advisory board. I have three that would give me great recommendations, but I'm concerned that having no professional/more recent references would be a problem.


My Question:


Considering my non-ideal background, is my best bet to ask one professor and both of my professional contacts, two professors and one professional, or ask all three professors?

I noticed that MIT's lectures didn't really build off each other; each AI topic was just a new way of thinking of how to model intelligence. GaTech seems to do the same, and It seems KBAI/ expert knowledge systems is a subset of AI as a whole, and the course provides a narrowed focus.

My purpose for attending is not necessarily to ""change"" professions, but to move into a more technical sort of legal practice known as patent law, specifically for software patent prosecution.  I currently work for a large tech company.

Patent prosecution requires passing the bar of the USPTO, which requires a technical degree.  Since I don't possess a technical degree, I began searching for an affordable online degree.  Computer Science was my preference because of its broad theoretical applicability, and i wound up here.

I am half way through taking the general course of prerequisite classes, for credit at a CC online: Python Computer Science, Data Structures, Computer Architecture, Algorithms, and Discrete Math.  So far, I have a 4.0. This is my entire experience with CS.

My question is two fold: do you think my use of the degree will be seen as ""legitimate"" by the admissions committee? Is there any precedent for this? Have not found one myself.  Also, I would really want to avoid a situation where the committee basically says ""I don't understand this reason for attending"" or ""I'm not sure if we would even make him eligible for the USPTO"" and reject me as a result.

>For example, if a student enrolls in a Fall 2018 course and withdraws (which would result in a “W” on his/her transcript), this counts as a record of enrollment for that semester.  Therefore, the student would need to sit out the Spring 2019 and Summer 2019 semesters before having to apply for readmission for Fall 2019 (or any semester thereafter).

Been practicing law 5 years and teaching myself code on the side (MOOCs, etc.). Haven't gotten formal certifications from the independent study courses. 

I understand that there's no hard-and-fast admissions rules about prior coursework/credentials, and that my experience would be more difficult than a CS undergrad's. My question is whether I likely need some kind of official-looking evidence of additional coursework before applying, and whether the coursework needs to be done through an accredited or other kind of institution.

pro: have a grade letter, real teachers.

I received my rejection letter last night and am unsure of what my next steps should be. They state the following:

>I am sorry to report that we are unable to admit you, as you do not have a computer science or closely related degree or other technical and/or engineering background. Your supporting materials indicate that you would have trouble succeeding in this extremely demanding program which encompasses a wide range of topics in Computer Science. 

However, I have a degree from Southern Methodist University in computer science. I had a 2.797 GPA but it seems like if my GPA were the issue, the rejection letter would have reflected that, rather than my ""lack of a degree"". 

My plan was to mention in an appeal that I have my degree and about half of the master's program classes coincide with some of my classes from undergrad (though I understand grad school is at a higher level). I was also going to ask a few professors for letters of recommendation vouching for my degree and knowledge of computer science.

I've also taken some very intense grad school courses as part of my undergraduate degree, as I was pursuing a 4+1 program - those classes are in game development, but on the programming side.

Has anyone been in a similar boat? Do I go through the formal appeals process or is there somewhere I might be able to reach sooner than an appeal? I would have accepted any other reasoning, especially mentioning my GPA, and gone through the proper channels, but this feels different.

I personally have never had an exam graded this way, nor have I graded this way (was at TA in undergrad).  You either start with full credit and points are deducted or you start with 0 points and earn points for correct answers.  I think it's unfair (yes I am aware, life isn't fair) to have to ""earn"" points AND have those points deducted from.  The penalty imo should have been no credit i.e. 0 points not negative points.

Sure the cost is much lower than the on-campus one, but I feel that research experience is more valuable. On the other hand, I don't want to quit this company simply because I'm getting really good experience.

For example,  I have some friends from out of state who are doing the OMSCS and the way  they described some of classes makes it seem more targeted towards working people who are just trying to get their feet wet in CS or people who didn't get as good of a background as they did in their undergrad. That being said, the acceptance rate for OMSCS is really high but there are claims that OMSCS is just as rigorous as the on-campus.

I don't want to try and defend myself too much, as I'm willing to accept the decision, but I graduated with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics about 2.5 years ago. My final GPA was about 3.04. My individual Computer Science GPA was slightly lower due to about a solid year of personal issues near the end (wife was pregnant with child with congenital birth defect so I worked 20+ hours a week to try and pay medical bills).  
  
I've worked professionally as a Software Engineer since I graduated. I've worked for a large corporation (250,000+ employees) and now a smaller company (500 employees). I even have a lot of experience in more advanced CS topics (Computation Photography, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning) through my employment. Personally, based on the work I am currently performing at my job, I felt like I was ready for the program. However, Georgia Tech did not.  
  
""While you do have an academic background in computer science or closely related field, your academic record, including GPA, indicates that you would have trouble succeeding in this extremely demanding program, which encompasses a wide range of topics in Computer Science. We would encourage you to take and successfully complete, with a grade of “B” or better, several accredited upper-level undergraduate or graduate courses in Computer Science in order that you would be better prepared for a future application to the OMSCS program."" 
   
Herein lies the problem. I chose OMSCS because a traditional college experience is no longer a reality for me. I work full time and have a family now (wife and 2 kids). There is literally no time for me to do any sort of campus learning. This is why OMSCS was so appealing. Yet, my rejection letter suggests that there is no better way for me to improve my chances of being accepted in the future. I feel like I've hit a brick wall.  
  
According to a study OMSCS themselves conducted, less than 10% of people rejected go on to pursue a masters at any other school at all for this exact reason (source: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/upshot/an-online-education-breakthrough-a-masters-degree-for-a-mere-7000.html).  
  
Does anyone have any constructive ideas for how to overcome this hurdle? I feel like it's too late for me to improve my chances on Georgia Tech's terms apart from simply continuing to work and hoping one day they say ""Well, now that you've got 7+ years experience under your belt we can dismiss how you performed in school when you were 18.""",2016-11-08 06:53:43

&#x200B;

I was accepted for Fall 2019 by the Dept.

&#x200B;

**My Background**: B.S. in Business Admin, Trident University International.

Took 5 supplementary courses at my alma mater this past year: Discrete Math, OOP (with Java), OS and Environments, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Computer Architecture. However, they were not very intensive courses, to say the least (although I aced them all).

I also took a couple of courses at MITx (edX MOOC): Intro to Programming w/Python, and Intro to Data Science w/ Python. I feel confident in my programming skills in Java and Python (and my ability to learn new programming languages on the fly), but am shoring up my math by taking Linear Algebra, Calculus (I know a bit already), C programming, Stats (I know a bit already), and Probability (also know a bit already) at MOOCs in the 6 Months until Classes at GT start. Also planning to take some MOOC course on Proofs before I do General Algos.

**Goals**: I live in Israel, currently work at IBM in a non-programming position. I want to get into Artificial Intelligence Research.

Questions:

* **Question**: Assuming they receive my official transcripts (I am using Certifile), I am for sure accepted, correct? Just getting paranoid.
* **Question**: I read on Reddit that there are paths to do published research, both through professors in the program, and through some courses (ED Tech was mentioned). Which courses would enable me to publish research, and/or might have professors who I could convince to do research papers with? What else could help me in this?
* **Question**:  Courses to take: I want to both shore up my lack of CS Background, and learn heavy duty AI/Machine Learning courses - I don't want to just take the easiest path to get the degree, I need to really learn my stuff. Given that, what do you think about this course list:

First Courses, 1 per semester: (in order of priority, i.e., will try for the first, if unavailable will try for the second, etc.):

1. [\*CS 7637 Knowledge-Based Artificial Intelligence: Cognitive Systems](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7637-knowledge-based-artificial-intelligence-cognitive-systems) \- Because it looks fun, and according to what I have read, is an easier course. I think I have all the reqs already, without any more learning at MOOCs. Won't take if I don't need it for my admission requirement.
2. \*[CS 6475 Computational Photography](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6475-computational-photography) \- Looks fun, seems relatively easy. Won't take if I don't need it for my admission requirement.
3. \*[CSE 6242 Data and Visual Analytics](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cse-6242-data-visual-analytics) \- Looks fun, seems relatively easy. Won't take if I don't need it for my admission requirement.
4. \*[CS 7646 Machine Learning for Trading](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7646-machine-learning-trading) \- Also an easier, fun looking course, that I have all the knowledge to do now. I actually wrote a machine learning program for predicting stocks in Python, but found out I was terribly dirtying my data. Ideally, I want to take this course later on with a 'medium' difficulty course. Also a ML Specialization elective.

The rest of the courses:

1. [\*CSE 6220 Intro to High-Performance Computing](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cse-6220-intro-hpc) \- b/c I need the background, given my non - CS education
2. [\*CS 6200 Introduction to Operating Systems](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-8803-introduction-operating-systems) \- b/c I need the background, given my non - CS education
3. [\*CS 6290 High Performance Computer Architecture](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6290-high-performance-computer-architecture) \- b/c I need the background, given my non- CS education
4. \*[CS 6460 Educational Technology](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6460-educational-technology) \- For research, also should be fun.
5. \*[CSE 6250 Special Topics: Big Data for Health Informatics](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cse-8803-special-topics-big-data-for-health-informatics) \- ML Specialization Elective, seems like a 'meaty' course.
6. \*[CS 6515 Intro to Graduate Algorithms](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-8803-ga-graduate-algorithms) (formerly CS 8803 GA Graduate Algorithms) - ML Specialization Requirement, necessary for my goals. I want to take it (if I can get in) before ML and Reinforcement Learning
7. [\*CS 7641 Machine Learning](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7641-machine-learning) \- ML Specialization Requirement, necessary for my goals. Taken before Reinforcement Learning
8. \*[CS 7642 Reinforcement Learning (\*\*Formerly CS 8803-O03 Special Topics: Reinforcement Learning)](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-8803-special-topics-reinforcement-learning)  \- ML Elective, necessary for my goals

I've read many of the decision posts in this subreddit over the past two years but haven't seen many ChemE stories.

I'll be graduating in a few months with a BS in Chemical Engineering and a minor in Computer Engineering. I've accepted a full time job in process control for a major paperboard manufacturer.

I really think I made a mistake going ChemE instead of EE/CS and think OMSCS would allow me to transition to a more fulfilling career. Embedded systems/IoT and ML are both topics I find myself spending even free time diving into and are both quite applicable to manufacturing (though I'm not dead set on manufacturing).

I'm willing to put in the time and effort over the next couple of years purely from a curiosity standpoint but what are the career implications? Am I better off diving head on into my job & working into a technology development type roll (already have spoke with a mentor about going this type of route)? Salary wise, from what I read, the bump wouldn't be very significant (I know multiple people in the same industry making 100k+ 3-4 years out of school) but I'm not really sure what a career in ML/AI or something similar looks like from a growth standpoint.

Being hard is not a bad thing, but the total lack of objective or quick feedback was very demoralizing for someone like me.

From what I read - Machine Learning for Trading is an excellent first class to take. It apparently helps prepare me for a lot of other classes under the ML track as well...

But I checked the registrar and it’s already booked - with only 272 remaining in a waitlist seat.

As an entering student - there is no way I think I am able to get into that class even if I’m right at my computer during my registration ticket time.

Do you guys have any recommendations on what I should do?",2018-12-13 10:15:37
